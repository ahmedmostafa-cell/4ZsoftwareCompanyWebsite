										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&#8217;s modern web design trends are all about interactive, responsive, and adaptive websites. The goal of these designs is to create an experience that is tailored to the user&#8217;s needs and can be accessed on a variety of devices. Here are 7 critical elements you need to focus on if you want your website to stand out in today&#8217;s competitive market: </span></p>
<h3><b>Branding with a Logo</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A professional website design should always have a logo to brand the layout. The primary reason for this is because most people will remember the site by its brand identity logo rather than remembering what it was they were trying to find on that particular page or blog post. Modern logos are designed with minimalism in mind, which means less text &#8211; think about Apple Inc.&#8217;s famous apple symbol being their only representation of identity instead of having the word &#8220;Apple&#8221; or any other words appearing in the design. A good rule of thumb when designing your own logo is to make sure you&#8217;re using simple line drawings, shapes, and colors that are easy on the eyes (think Google&#8217;s minimalist logo). Also, make sure you avoid </span><a href="https://www.logodesign.net/logo-design-mistakes-avoid"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mistakes in designing a company logo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that your design can stick out from the noise.</span></p>
<h3><b>Responsive Layout Design</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The days of different versions for desktop and mobile are over. The </span><a href="https://webflow.com/blog/web-design-trends-2021"><span style="font-weight: 400;">modern web design trend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to create responsive websites that automatically adjust according to the device used or screen size &#8211; this means you don&#8217;t need a separate version for both! This also has the added benefit of increased reach, as more people in developing countries where internet access is limited will be able to see your site with their smartphone than would have been possible before. Avoiding creating separate versions saves time, effort, and money which allows you more freedom when designing your layout because it does not require much work on your part!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A responsive web design works by automatically adjusting elements in order for them to fit properly into any given display. This means less work for you as the designer which allows you more time to focus on other important aspects of your site!</span></p>
<h3><b>HTML Coding </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern websites are built using HTML coding language and use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) stylesheets to create their layouts. The advantage here is that these languages can be updated without having to go through tedious troubleshooting like older technologies would require or have trouble updating at all because they simply cannot be upgraded.</span></p>
<h3><b>Conversion Optimized Website </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing an aesthetically pleasing, well-designed website is only half the battle; you also need one that converts traffic into customers &#8211; this means making sure your content does not contain typos and other errors which could turn away viewers before they even get through the doorway. A </span><a href="https://neilpatel.com/what-is-conversion-optimization"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conversion-optimized webpage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does just what it sounds like: convert those browsing visitors into paying customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are some tips to help you build conversion-optimized sites:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have text that&#8217;s easy to read and understand</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide a clear call to action (CTA) button </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid flashing images or graphics on the page, as they can be irritating for some viewers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include testimonials and case studies </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Showcase your company&#8217;s history</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Mobile Responsive</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet the new boss; same as the old boss &#8211; just smaller! Mobile devices like smartphones now make up over half of all global web traffic so providing responsive layouts or designs with small screens in mind can really help boost those numbers.</span></p>
<h3><b>Accessibility</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&#8217;s modern web design trends have a heavy emphasis on accessibility because it provides opportunities for users with disabilities. Achieving this means examining your website and identifying anything that may not be accessible to all audiences &#8211; like assistive technologies or otherwise limited resources. Once you know what the problem is, then see how you can fix it! There are plenty of tools available online which will help make things easier on designers who might lack certain skill sets.</span></p>
<h3><b>Security </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number one priority in today&#8217;s digital world should always come down to security. This means making sure that your site is protected from hackers and other cyber threats. The best way to do this is by </span><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-ssl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which encrypts all data passed between your server and the end-user. Make sure to install SSL on your site as soon as you host your domain &#8211; hackers are already out there waiting to take advantage of you!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from SSL, other things you can do to enhance the security of your website include:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Configuring security features on your hosting service, like password protection and a firewall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a strong password that&#8217;s not common or easy to guess</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take advantage of two-step verification which means that before logging into your site, you&#8217;ll need to provide the username and password in addition to a code sent via text message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use login attempts blocking plugins or a firewall plugin that can block hackers by preventing login attempts</span></p>

<h2><b>Final Thoughts</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to keep up with modern web design trends so that your customers don&#8217;t feel like they&#8217;re being taken back ten years or more when visiting your website along with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our custom </span><a href="https://www.aryausa.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website development Company in USA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> build efficient and innovative digital tools for your business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Make sure all visitors have an enjoyable experience by designing a layout that is simple yet visually appealing, carefully selecting font colors and styles for readability purposes, and making use of responsive layouts while also providing accessible options for everyone! </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years </span><a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/what-is-software-development-and-maintenance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IT application development and maintenance service<b>s</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> costs have skyrocketed. That&#8217;s why it is a no-brainer to fathom, why companies outsourcing their IT needs to third-party vendors that help them to save a hefty amount without lagging behind the competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large corporations like DuPont cracked a deal with Computer Science Corp. and Andersen Consulting for a whopping $4 billion to manage its IT.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are thousands of companies out there in the market but blindfolded pick and choose any company to handle your IT operations could cost dearly and there are a handful of companies in the market which actually stand up to the expectation of clients. Our visionary team at</span> Aryavrat Infotech<span style="font-weight: 400;"> puts collective effort to deliver the project beyond the client&#8217;s expectations.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Why do you need to outsource </b></h2>
<h3><b>Reduce monthly expenses </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Training your employees always costs a large chunk of your monthly budget but </span>outsourcing<span style="font-weight: 400;"> can not only save you money but allows you to gain more productivity via experienced resources. don’t need to spend to develop extra infrastructure.</span></p>
<h3><b>Team size </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a particular project is outsourced you don’t need to hire or recruit people of a specific skill set which does help you to keep your team size small.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The small team requires less workspace and eventually brings down the monthly expenditure. Around the clockwork in all time zones, you can assign the work, sit back, and relax.</span></p>
<h3><b>Support Issue </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing 24*7 support is a tough ask for a small and mid-cap firm but it plays a crucial role as well in business growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having an offshore support team can be very handy &amp; easier to handle. Language barriers can be easily overcome.</span></p>

<h2><b>How you can avoid outsourcing failures </b></h2>
<h3><b>Unclear Expectation </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before heading in rightly assessing the project requirements and scope in a comprehensive manner, hazy objectives or unclear expectations could lead to a deadlock so it&#8217;s important to have a clear vision of the project. </span></p>
<h3><b>Lack of Communication </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time to time dialogue between client and partner is really essential for the success of any project. Sometimes lack of communication leads to delays in the timeline and various other issues that can badly affect the project. </span></p>
<h3><b>Detailed Service Level Agreement (SLA)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SLAs are an integral part of any outsourcing contract before making any commitment with your partner to pen down all the benchmarks and sign a detailed contract to prevent any misconception in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A detailed contract with the service provider lays out all the services that a client is expected to receive. Apart from the services and responsibilities of a service provider, an ideal SLA should include the metrics to measure the quality and services. </span></p>
<h3><b>Low on Budget </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost and quality go hand in hand, having high expectations but being low on a budget don&#8217;t go well. You will always have to compromise on either side. </span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you planning to modernize your pharmacy or looking to structure a new one? Managing a pharmacy isn&#8217;t an easy task. You have to manage many different types of things like serve patients, distribute drugs, monitor patients&#8217; drugs, review physicians’ orders, manage insurance forms, and bill insurance companies. Managing a pharmacy can even be more time-consuming and challenging if you do all this work manually or by hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the increasing pace of technology advancement, all these problems can be solved by an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=online%20medicine%20delivery%20app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online medicine delivery app</a> company. By implementing this software into your pharmacy you can get benefits in such ways as it helps in streamlining the work, examining the issues, making things easy to manage, and fetching correct reports; overall running the pharmacy persuasively and the most important one, it helps in improving customer satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s find out some more details about this how it can be helpful and what it takes to develop a pharmacy management software</span></p>
<h2><b>What Is a Pharmacy Management Software?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pharmacy Management Software, also known as the pharmacy information software, is a system that stores data and enables functionality that organizes the medication use process within pharmacies. The system is an independent technology for the hospital setting and pharmacy&#8217;s use only. It is possible to integrate pharmacy services within physician order entry systems (CPOE) in hospitals. </span></p>
<h2><b>5 Mandatory Features For a Pharmacy</b></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1864 size-full" src="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pharmacy_2.jpg" alt="Pharmacy" width="500" height="500" srcset="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pharmacy_2.jpg 500w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pharmacy_2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pharmacy_2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pharmacy_2-200x200.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<h2><b>Management System</b></h2>
<h3><b>Inventory Management</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the most important features that must be integrated into Pharmacy Management Software. According to a recent study, pharmacologists spend almost one-fifth of the workday on managing inventory only. As it requires plenty of time to design, track, and analyze paper-based processes. But, when inventory is tracked via an automated system; your staff doesn&#8217;t need to spend their time on paper-based inventory management. Their time can be utilized in other important activities.</span></p>
<h3><b>Documents and Data Management</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day, pharmacists interact with a huge number of patients; and a lot of data and docs of these patients circulating around a pharmacy. Storing and managing properly this data manually can be time-consuming for the working staff. Pharmacy management software can easily store this data; you can use it later for inspection purposes or for improving workflows. Thus document and data management is also an important feature that should be available in the system.</span></p>
<h3><b>Multi-Store and Multi-Location Support</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another key feature is multi-location support that means a user must be able to manage his multi-located pharmacy stores easily at a time from anywhere by using the pharmacy <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/mobile-app-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mobile App Development Services in USA</a>. A complete view of multi-located stores gives users a veritable overview of stock levels, all profits, and losses. As the user will be able to keep an eye on all stores&#8217; stock levels, profit, and loss by using a single software.</span></p>
<h3><b>User Management Module</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An accurate analytic report of your pharmacy will make you capable to analyze the pharmacy’s performance. Get insights into expenses, sales, and overall generated revenue.</span></p>
<h3><b>Integrations</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, make sure to integrate the software with the tools you already use to run your pharmacy. Integration with other tools like e-prescribing software and point of sale(PoS) systems. It will make you able to facilitate prescriptions, record transactions, and update inventory automatically. It will reduce the headache of staff members and increase the workflow of your pharmacy.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology is evolving and we witness this every single day with the exposure of new innovative technology in the market. But nowadays, customer attention seeker is mobile app development whether its mobile app development company or businesses looking to develop a mobile application for them. To serve the mobile app development requirement, there are numerous programming tools available in the market. It is Flutter that has gained more popularity and adoption. Let us discuss Flutter in detail.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1886 size-full" src="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/app_development_illu_k25BW.jpg" alt="app development illustration" width="626" height="417" srcset="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/app_development_illu_k25BW.jpg 626w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/app_development_illu_k25BW-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/app_development_illu_k25BW-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Flutter?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutter is created by Google. This is an open-source UI software development kit and used for cross-platform Mobile App Development. It means the application developed using Flutter can be run on the different operating systems including Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web using a single codebase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutter was introduced in 2015 as a beta version named “Sky”. However, Google with time works on Flutter improvement by resolving issues that occurred during Mobile App Development. In 2018, Google released a Flutter stable version named Flutter 1.0 introduced at the Flutter Live event. After that, it started gaining popularity in <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/mobile-app-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mobile App Development Services in USA</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, the Flutter released its latest version of Flutter 1.12, this was Google’s biggest release of the year. This version was released by resolving 5303 issues, and 5970 Pull requests from around 484 contributors around the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While on 6th May 2020, Flutter 1.17 version was released, in this version Metal API was added, iOS device performance improved, new material widgets and network tracking tools were also added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutter code is written in the Dart programming language. Let’s have a brief introduction to Dart.         </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Dart?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dart is a programming language created by Google. Dart used to develop a mobile app, web servers, and also utilities for IoT devices. In the latest version of Flutter 1.17, the Dart programming language has been updated from Dart 2.7 to Dart 2.8. The updated Dart offers an extra advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Javascript compiler compiles the code in Dart. Writing code in Dart is quite similar to writing code in Java and c#.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutter Working</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Flutter app development is all about a combination of widgets. It provides different types of widgets like structure, styling, layout, and others. Using these widgets, one can easily craft a UI of a mobile app. Flutter doesn’t face any issue while complaining about the programming language to other platforms using Javascript. Flutter comes with a reactive style view and employs Dart for writing apps that’s why it doesn’t face issues.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dart automatically compiles ahead of time into native code for different platforms without using the Javascript bridge. This scaled up the app startup time automatically to the next level.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutter is the only <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/top-cross-platform-app-development-framework-in-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross-platform mobile app development</a> that comes with a reactive view. This attracts a number of developers towards Flutter.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Flutter is best from other cross-platform frameworks?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutter&#8217;s outstanding features make it unique from other cross-platform mobile application frameworks. The flutter feature includes:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Single Code</span></h3>
<p>You can write Flutter code once and use it for developing apps on both iOS and Android.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hot Reload</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature allows you to see instant results of changes made in code. This improves the performance of the application. There is no need to reload the app because changes happen in real-time.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Widget</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutter has a wide range of widgets to create UI/UX views. You can also create your own widgets according to your needs and you can save it for further use. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">High Performance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutter is the best to run your application as compared to other cross-platform mobile app frameworks. It uses Dart programming language that enables applications to offer native performance with a speed of 60 FPS.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutter App Development Benefits</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutter App is beneficial for business owners in many ways:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consume Less Time</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutter uses a single codebase for both platforms iOS and Android. This results in less consumption of time and resources throughout the development process. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">High Performance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile Apps developed using the Flutter framework are highly efficient in performance. Flutter uses Dart as a programming language and has its own widgets that enable fast start-up time and lesser performance issues.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower Development Time</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hot reload feature made an instant view of changes made in code. If any error occurs that can be resolved in no time and the developer can keep on working. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compatibility</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutter applications are compatible with different platforms. It also supports different versions of OS. the use of its own widgets lesser the compatibility issue.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Source</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutter is an open-source framework that allows developers around the globe to help each other.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.aryausa.com/get-in-touch" target="_blank" rel="https://www.aryausa.com/get-in-touch noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1887 size-full" src="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/request_a_quote_2.jpg" alt="Request A Quote " width="750" height="170" srcset="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/request_a_quote_2.jpg 750w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/request_a_quote_2-300x68.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future of Flutter in <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/looking-for-an-awesome-mobile-app-development-company-in-the-usa">Mobile App Development</a></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to my view, Flutter has a bright future and can achieve greater heights in the coming future. Flutter recently witnessed the launch of its latest version Flutter 1.12 with improvement. The latest version helps to build an amazing UX/UX view and high app performance, The time and resources used also reduce. Flutter will grow amazingly in the upcoming future with its many new versions like Flutter 1.13 and 1.14.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Software Development Outsourcing?</span></h2>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Outsourcing Models</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dedicated Team</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing companies take care of most of the processes, including staffing, scaling, controlling quality, managing teams, etc. This model of outsourcing uses the strength of the outsourcing organization to the utmost and ensures the client that they don’t have to worry about the project from start to end. Clients can directly manage and run the team if they have any specific requirements depending on the project. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project-Based Model</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project-based Model is becoming famous due to its flexibility and full commitment to a single project. The outsourcing organization has given all the responsibilities of the project from start to end that includes setting expectations, evaluating requirements, and using appropriate technologies &amp; skills. In this way, the client only has to focus on the final product rather than focusing on the ongoing process and deployment. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff Augmentation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this method, outsourcing the company works together with the client to improve productivity by utilizing the client’s current resources along with the relevant services and contract employees, supported by the company to develop the best &amp; high-quality result.  </span></p>

<h3><strong>Normalize Medical Knowledge</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI can help to share the knowledge and performance of experts to the providers who lack that expertise. This type of normalization is important because highly skilled experts are rare compared to the need in many areas. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Medical Practice Drudgery Automation</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI has automated many of the tasks on which providers spend a large amount of time dealing with electronic medical records, reading screens, and typing on a keyboard.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI can help to allocate resources and shape the industry. This AI system even helps to identify which department needs more staffing, and the most controversial topic of revenue-maximizing practice.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some tech innovation in the healthcare industry using AI </span></h2>
<h3><strong>Robotic Reflection</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017 University of Bristol study found that children suffering from Autism have an issue in distinguishing facial expression and in that year Dell technologies launched Milo, a 2-foot tall robot that helps children from ages 5 to 17 years to identify signs of emotion.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Connecting ALS Patients </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eye-tracking glasses have developed to help people who lost the ability to speak. People can type with their eyes onto a monitor screen that will vocalize the patient’s thoughts through computerized decoding.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Detecting Afib</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atrial fibrillation can make heart attacks or strokes more likely and according to research from Stanford University shows that AI software can identify more accurately arrhythmias from an electrocardiogram (EKG) than a human expert. </span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial Intelligence is changing the way we use technology. A recent article found that 80% of the companies will be using chatbots by 2020.  Chatbots are interactive software that is used in apps, live chats, emails, and SMS, and behave like humans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many business owners said that they will use a chatbot in sales, marketing, and customer service. 42% of owners believe that in automation technology customer experience will improve and 48% said they are already using a chatbot for their business function.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of chatting with rather than using traditional channel</span></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is faster than any other means of communication</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provides higher quality feedback</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Answers are honest</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatbots provide a more personalized service experience for customers. A chatbot is a perfect tool to confidently transition leads from consideration to conversion. The main reason for investing is to improve the customer experience and another reason is that customers don’t like to wait in this fast-moving world. It is forecasted that the chatbot market will reach $1.25 billion by 2025.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1936 size-full" src="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/workspace_with_robot_UohZX.jpg" alt="workspace-with-robot-working-computer-keyboard-top-view" width="626" height="313" srcset="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/workspace_with_robot_UohZX.jpg 626w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/workspace_with_robot_UohZX-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The on-time response is the key to meet customer expectations. No one in this fast-paced world wants to wait for hours before the support team turns up for the user queries. Whatever your service or product is, your business success depends on how strongly you are connected to your users, and how quickly you resolve your customer queries. Every chatbot provider is updated with the latest trend of AI and voice assistants to keep up with the technology enhancement and offer a constant brand experience.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Chatbot helps businesses to improve customer services and support</span></h2>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer Support Enhancement</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human customer support agents can handle only a few concerns at a time but with the help of chatbots, organizations can handle an undefined number of customers. By this productivity of businesses can be boosted and allow human agents to focus on other tasks.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Satisfied Customer</span></h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this pandemic situation, most businesses are working remotely. Business owners are left with no option rather than closing their organization for some time or permanently. But during this period, outsourcing is one of the best options to choose from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing software, Web, or <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/mobile-app-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mobile App development services in USA</a> can minimize the operational cost of your business. From profit maximization, this helps your organization become introduced to professional experts, on-time delivery of projects, efficiency, and productivity in the work done. This also enhances customer service, experience, and maintains the quality of the project in a <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/get-affordable-website-in-less-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tight budget and a fixed deadline.</a></span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1767" src="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/telecommuting-concept-illustration_114360-1620.jpg" alt="How virtual team can help businesses to increase revenue:" width="352" height="352" srcset="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/telecommuting-concept-illustration_114360-1620.jpg 626w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/telecommuting-concept-illustration_114360-1620-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/telecommuting-concept-illustration_114360-1620-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/telecommuting-concept-illustration_114360-1620-200x200.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How virtual team can help businesses to increase revenue:</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lessen Cost</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many business owners hire <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/how-to-get-rid-of-issues-while-outsourcing-the-development-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remote teams for Development Services</a> to cut costs. Outsourcing can reduce the cost by up to 50% compared to depending on the in-house team. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expert Service</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outsourced development team deals with experts in the field. You are able to deal with the best IT and technology experts that can develop your project perfectly within the given time.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work With a Managed Team</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are outsourcing the work you don’t need to hire project managers,<a href="https://desktrack.timentask.com/blog/build-a-successful-remote-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> remote teams</a> will do the work for you. Your in-house management can guide them about the project and daily compliance is done by them.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Save Time</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this pandemic time, Administrating, developing, and marketing can be a heavy task for an organization but hiring the virtual team can help you to focus on the marketing of the project and can be ahead of their competitors.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1941 size-full" src="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/save_time.jpg" alt="save your time" width="500" height="500" srcset="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/save_time.jpg 500w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/save_time-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/save_time-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/save_time-200x200.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proper Support</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There can be an issue like the need for continuous support, maintenance, and updating of software, all can be maintained by the outsourcing organization. While you can focus on any other tasks.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally Choose The Expert</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To develop a project you can handpick experts from all over the world in case of outsourcing, locally hiring can be more expensive too.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use The Latest Technology</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing organizations use cutting-edge technology that is familiar with the latest languages, frameworks, and development tools. Spending dollars on software &amp; training can be more expensive than hiring a handful of skilled experts on that.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speed &amp; Flexibility</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speed and flexibility are the key points for hiring a virtual team. The team spends less possible time and is flexible on any development project as they have already done the type of work and all the tasks involved.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing is now becoming a fast-growing industry considering the current situation in mind. Hiring a virtual team can be beneficial for your business and help to increase revenue. Above mentioned points of how virtual teams can help businesses grow can be considered by businesses to expand their growth.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have mentioned some of the business vertices responsible for increasing demand</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entertainment</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are numerous video on and music streaming applications that help the user search a variety of series, soundtracks around the world. Users can get instant real-time access.       </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real Estate</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the growing economy real estate also contributes. Real estate agents and business owners are growing towards the on-demand service apps to find the answers to problems such as no need for brokers, lower cost, time efficiency, decreasing the need for on-site agents, and ease of selling or buying the property. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tourism</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traveling and tourism are some of the industries that boost up the economy. Previously we have to wait for hours on the odd time, public holiday and have to face issues to travel to remote locations. But after the development of mobile apps like Ola, Uber, and other more applications. This made it easy for users to get a cab easily for traveling, escape from the refusal of taxi drivers, etc. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/the_travel_price.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1963 size-full" src="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/the_travel_price.jpg" alt="The Travel Price" width="698" height="433" srcset="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/the_travel_price.jpg 698w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/the_travel_price-300x186.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /></a></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food Delivery</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definite working hours and waiting in a long queue in stores, restaurants, and other eateries outlets has resulted in the demand for online delivery services. This idea has helped the customers to taste the delicious food in no time and also given restaurant owners a high return on investment options. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/platerate.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1964 size-full" src="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/platerate.jpg" alt="Platerate" width="631" height="371" srcset="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/platerate.jpg 631w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/platerate-300x176.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px" /></a></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthcare</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, patients had to stand in a queue for booking an appointment, hospital staff have to maintain the heap of data files, and reach the pharmacy for medicines within a specific time duration. This all is making healthcare facilities very difficult at the time of emergencies. But with the help of service apps, all things have changed dynamically. This has provided facilities such as medicine home delivery, online doctors appointment, instant data sharing, and many more. This all has lower down the cost, times, and errors. And helped reach the facility to a large number of people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you might have got the idea that on-demand service apps have covered the entire marketplace. You also got the idea to use these apps successfully and efficiently to enter the on-demand economy and earn higher profits.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online and offline both the presence are equivalent necessary for business owners to run a business. Digital Marketing requires a little bit more budget and time to set up the things and give the results but the organization that has enough budget and time to invest in digital marketing can create an influential presence in the market that leads customers to buy products. Offline presence helps businesses to directly communicate with the customers. The offline business even brings a sense of trust in customers.  </span></p>
<h2>Problem Faced By Businesses Without Online &amp; Offline Presence</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without showing presence, it&#8217;s very difficult for any organization to grow or expand in the current global market. Without promotion, businesses won’t be able to promote or advertise their products and services. </span></p>

You won’t be able to build authority with your customers and increase the upward payment rate and win the competitive race against other websites and mobile listings, agencies. There can be problems in marketing a product or service which hasn’t started or developed. </span></p>
<h2>Solutions That Can Help</h2>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Through Product Presentation</h3>

Whatever your brand or business is, it will be improved from an<a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/things-to-know-about-branding-of-products-digitally" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> expanded number of digital resources</a>.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s customers pursue all knowledge before purchase, so presenting all the information to get the knowledge is more efficient. Business owners have to illustrate their marketplace products in such a way that the products are easy to understand, and they lay out sufficient specific product information to attract purchase. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Improve Collection With Data Awareness</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many customers like to buy from the businesses that serve their interests; therefore their product or service matters a lot. Businesses that invest resources in data analytics have profited a lot in the form of more personalized and customized service that acknowledges the needs of their customers. </span></p>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Campaign Flexibility</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campaigns made by the businesses on online and offline engagement should include few factors such as their customers and their expectations, company skills and experience, performance capabilities, competitors, and their approach. Businesses have to look for which key performance indicators should be changed or pulled back. </span></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your business is idiosyncratic in the offering; you will surely succeed online and offline. Customers prefer to meet with trustworthy individuals and brands so organizations should present their temperament in their branding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers discover realness when companies generate interest through digital channels. Combining your commitment to cybersecurity with a strong understanding to present fresh visual presentations will help speed online sales. It’s the finest time to make your organization on the fast track for even better success.</span></p>

<h2>The Need for Mobile Apps in E-commerce Business</h2>
<h3>Presence To Your Customer</h3>
<p>Users are investing most of their time on mobile phones. So while introducing the mobile app you can reach richer heights to your business.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last few years, the scope of traditional taxi services has almost finished. Competition is too intense, customer loyalty is almost non-existent, cheaper transport providers are stepping in. Uber-like taxi booking apps are taking the market away from traditional taxi services. The reality is that Uber-like taxi services are growing rapidly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the reports, in the last year, Cab companies earned a profit of $3.5 billion. Around 41% of Android users have a Taxi booking app installed on their smartphones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you already have a taxi service or planning to come into this market, having a taxi booking app (Mobile App) is the best way. By developing a mobile app to complement their existing service, a top-rated <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/success-stories">taxi app development company</a> can make it easier for customers to book a ride. A taxi app can make life easier for drivers as well.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Stats_arya-2.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1349" src="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Stats_arya-2.png" alt="Taxi booking apps overview" width="751" height="548" srcset="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Stats_arya-2.png 751w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Stats_arya-2-300x219.png 300w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Stats_arya-2-200x147.png 200w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Stats_arya-2-82x60.png 82w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Taxi Booking App Service</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A full-featured taxi booking solution requires you to invest in various things like servers, Dashboard panel, Mobile apps, etc.  You may have to establish partnerships with taxi companies or individuals and offer them an app with two discrete interfaces — one for taxi riders, the other for taxi drivers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of GPS, a server identifies the current location of a user in need of a taxi and notifies the nearest driver. In this case, it’s super important to be able to monitor drivers’ locations.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main features of a Taxi Booking App</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple User Interface</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A well-designed mobile app will increase your user&#8217;s experience. An easy-to-use interface will provide your customers with a user-oriented and quick ride booking experience that will further help in increasing user engagements. It would also be suitable for drivers who would remain connected to their client base.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location tracking</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The taxi booking must have the capability of tracking the real-time location of the driver and the rider. The location tracking feature will help to find the nearest driver, and once the driver has accepted the request, the app shows an estimated arrival time until the driver arrives at the rider.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accurate Fare Calculation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can calculate the fare on different aspects like a flat fee for a ride based on areas and cost per mile. You can set a fare calculation process as per the locations for multiple fare calculations.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">SOS Contacts</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this feature, riders can add emergency contacts. With this function, the rider can send a text to the added contacts with the present location of the driver.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Favorite Destinations</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riders must be able to set the list of favorite locations like home, work, and hotel, so they don&#8217;t have to set the exact location every time. This feature will save the time of both rider and driver as the rider can book a ride in less time.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment Options</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There should be multiple payment options like cash, credit cards, debit cards, and other e-wallets. So riders can choose payment options according to their comfort.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rider Trip History</span></h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branding is the creative, strategic, and ideal process of telling potential customers what your company is all about: who you are, what services you provide, what they can expect from you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you know, today’s era is moving towards digital. It is quite necessary to maintain your presence everywhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While branding a product, we make the product connect to people.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Digital Branding</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital branding is a brand management technique that uses a combination of internet branding and digital marketing. Digital branding gives your brand story a presence in the digital space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your audience is being showered with advertising and marketing messages which promote a special relationship. But it is your story and presentation which sets you apart from the competition in the digital space. Digital branding is all about this.</span></p>
<h2>Why Digital marketing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless your website comes under in the top 10 positions on a major search engine, your chances of being found by your prospective clients and customers are very less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving search engine position means more reach on your website and a direct impact on your business growth. A survey found 60% of consumers prefer to buy products from their familiar brands. you may be competing against big brands with devoted customers and good marketing strategies.</span></p>
<p><b>Digital marketing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has emerged over the last few years. The increase in the number of personal devices and their use means brand marketers have many more ways of communicating with their target consumers or customers. It&#8217;s no surprise that branding concepts should be applied to digital media and technology to develop brands through interactions with consumers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of Digital Branding</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cost-effective way to market your business.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most measurable form of marketing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It allows you to target your ideal buyers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SEO helps you reach more qualified buyers online.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing helps you connect with potential customers all over the social media platforms</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ways to branding your own product </span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Build Conversion based website </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build a website that needs to focus on your customers, building a website that is fully integrated into your marketing and branding programs should be effectively done. Design the websites with interactive UI and create visibility into what your site visitors are doing on your website to give them the most relevant and engaging brand experience. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1988 size-full" src="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/aryaseo_1024x768.jpg" alt="SEO Analytics" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/aryaseo_1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/aryaseo_1024x768-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/aryaseo_1024x768-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Invest in your SEO and PPC</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people get worried about this because it&#8217;s generally going to require cash or an infusion of investment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, keep in mind that, this is where your marketing pays you back. Search Engine Marketing, or SEM, is a form of Internet Marketing that seeks to promote websites by increasing their efficiency in Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) through the use of search engine optimization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid placement, content marketing, and paid inclusion. We see SEM as a rather broad term. It is everything that can be done to use search engine technology to promote a website and increase its traffic, its &#8220;adherence&#8221;, and, in the case of sites that promote a business (or are a business), increase profits. </span><a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/search-engine-optimization-seo-the-heart-of-your-online-success" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Search Engine Optimization</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (SEO), therefore, would be a subset of SEM. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on your pay-per-click advertising, your PPC. this is a pay-per-play game, but statistically speaking, more people will be interacting with ads at the top of a Google search result, or Bing, or anywhere else. that you&#8217;re listing your ads.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Focus on your Online Reputation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Totally a Brand awareness campaign</span></p>
<p><strong>Here is a question: how?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look Most people nowadays using social media and so many other portals where people spend the rest of the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my opinion, If 86% of people will not interact with a brand, meaning they won&#8217;t purchase from you, they won&#8217;t give you their information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have no reviews, If you are spending on your marketing but if you don&#8217;t have good reviews and your market reputation is not good then all of that is a waste. Make sure you&#8217;re focusing on having a great online reputation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making sure you have good reviews as well as there should be reviews like Google My Business and Facebook.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Focus on your Social Media Marketing  </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Media not only for brand awareness but also for Business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on your social media, these are free platforms for you to set up and all they do is expand your digital ownership and presence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">58% of consumers say that social media influences their shopping behaviors. Social networks have become an easily accessible platform for anyone with Internet access. Increased communication for organizations fosters brand awareness and better customer service. Additionally, social media serves as a relatively inexpensive platform for organizations to implement marketing campaigns. With the emergence of services like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram the barrier to entry in social media is greatly reduced.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Invest in your Marketing Via Content</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content can really be done literally in many ways, depending on other channels and intentions. Optimizing tweets, improving email content, creating winning B2B content strategies, increasing marketing content results &#8211; it&#8217;s all about tailoring and focusing on the elements that are important to your goals and those of your audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, invest in videos, because Videos are your 24/7 salesperson. So, if you&#8217;re building up your content based on videos, which float the information that you are going to provide to your customers then you&#8217;re building trust, marketing value to your customers that will make them trust you.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Thoughts </span></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have an idea for a product but are not sure if you can successfully implement it or not? The majority of startups fail because the market doesn’t need them. Bringing a product to market is always a big risk. But to minimize the risk, you can first develop a minimum viable product (MVP)</span><b>.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To understand what customers need from your product, you should develop a minimum viable product. MVP allows you to study the situation on the market as well as its costs, also less than a full-fledged solution.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is An MVP</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and getting feedback for future product development.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Purpose Of A Minimum Viable Product</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A minimum viable product includes only essential features that will solve the customers’ problems. Everything else will be developed after reviewing the user feedback. Companies only develop MVP to verify the economic viability of the product.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP Goals</span></h2>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Testing product viability at low costs.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Spending less money on product development.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Faster delivery of a product that solves at least one problem of a user.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits Of MVP</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faster Release And Cutting The Development Costs</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In MVP, you only spend time in building features that are absolutely needed which save from investing in development cost as well as beneficial as quick delivery of the product</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Room For Evolution</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An MVP benefits your business by providing an engine for growth. Because you can receive valuable feedback from early users and can use this feedback to update your product. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing Business Concepts And Market Demand</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest benefit of developing an MVP is that it allows organizations to test their business concepts and ideas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP process to not only test the feasibility of their respective products but also to develop functionality over time based on user test data and feedback to gradually evolve towards the mature applications.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get The Funding From The Investor</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Receiving funding from the investor is to build confidence in the product and its ability to achieve the desired outcome. By representing your MVP you can easily impress the investors to invest in your product. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How To Build An MVP</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure Out, What Problem You Are Solving And For Whom</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of developing an MVP is quite simple. Your goal in creating an MVP is to create the smallest, fastest, and most functional version of your idea, something that can be tested quickly and easily, over and over again, until it works. Before you initiate an idea and embark upon an MVP Development process, ensure that it fulfills the target users’ needs</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Define The User Flow</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To define the main flow of users, we must first define the stages of the process. You need to look at the app from the users’ perspective. This is actually quite easy because all you need to do is explain the steps necessary to achieve the main objective of your product. As soon as all these steps of the process are defined, we can define characteristics for each stage.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">List Out The Features</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Now all the features under the categories should be graded ‘must-have,’ ‘nice-to-have, and ‘don’t care.’ can story-making techniques make this process easier. You can build a matrix where you have a horizontal row that shows the main stages of the process (our user flow) and below each stage a series of features dedicated to this stage.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have added all the steps and features for each step, you can draw a vertical down arrow that goes from &#8220;high priority&#8221; at the top of the column to &#8220;low priority&#8221; at the bottom. Now, you&#8217;re ready to start organizing features based on priority. Move stories that are crucial up the column and other stories down. Always pay attention to the whole process.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">When you have prioritized all features, you can define your scope for the first version of the product as well as M.V.P can proceed to create, if you want to see how your future product will be, so you can create an M.V.P prototype first.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build, Test, And Learn</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the first step of work is defined, so we move towards development, as soon as the development work is completed then we need to test it. The first testing phase is conducted by our <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-ai-in-software-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quality Assurance engineers</a>. which is to enhance the quality of the product. They ensure that a product is prepared for alpha or beta testing. you can start improving your product again and then try, and learn, and build again, and try again, and learn again. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyze Your Competitors</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is clear to say that if there is already a similar product in the market, then you must also make a competitor analysis, keep in mind if you think so, that you have no competitors in the market, your belief in the uniqueness of your product is not a sufficient reason to bring your product to the market with confidence. Competitor analysis is important no matter what the situation. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence is one of the most talkative things in the marketplace nowadays. It refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software testing is an important process that ensures customer satisfaction in the application. But what does it really mean? How does AI in software testing make a difference?</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1358" style="width: 778px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Quote-768x161-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1358" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1358 size-full" src="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Quote-768x161-2.png" alt="Artificial Intelligence" width="768" height="161" srcset="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Quote-768x161-2.png 768w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Quote-768x161-2-300x63.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1358" class="wp-caption-text">Artificial Intelligence</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of AI in software testing is still in its initial stage, and the level of autonomy is much lower than seen in more evolved areas, although it is still driving forward in the direction of autonomous testing. The application of AI in software testing tools is focused on making the software development lifecycle easier. AI can be used to help automate and reduce the number of  tedious tasks in development and testing</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How AI is changing the way of Software Testing</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Need for AI in Software Testing</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software testing is a procedure that constitutes a very fundamental aspect in the area of development. AI application in software testing focuses on facilitating the life cycle of <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/custom-software-development">Custom software development</a>. Since 60% of testing is only a repetition of the checks that the software already possesses, Artificial Intelligence will be helpful to automate the processes in an efficient way. Artificial Intelligence can be tremendously helpful in the testing industry in making more productive software for the end-user.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI Impact on Software Testing </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI is a growing trend for the world, as you say that AI influences software testing and autonomic various business processes, <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/how-artificial-intelligence-ai-help-in-the-healthcare-industry">AI helps</a> itself by increasing the quality of software testing.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of AI in</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Improved Accuracy:- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is human nature to make a mistake, even the micro examiner makes a mistake, This is where automated testing helps by performing the same steps accurately. </span></li>
<li><b>Automate the process:-</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  With automated testing, it may increase the scope of the test as well as improve the quality of the software. Automated software testing can look into memory and file contents, internal program states, and data tables so that it can be determined whether the software is working or not.</span></li>
<li><b>Saved time and money:-</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Source code is also modified each time with software testing, repeating these tests manually can be time-consuming and extremely costly. By using automation processes we can reduce the time spent in the testing which directly turns into cost savings.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some AI-based testing tool</span></h3>
<p><b>Test.ai:-</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Test.ai is mobile test automation That uses AI in continuous testing, It is useful when it comes to getting your application performance metrics. It is more of a monitoring tool than a functional test tool.</span></p>
<p><b>Functionize:-</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Functionize uses machine learning for functional testing and is very similar to other tools in the market regarding its capabilities such as being able to create tests quickly (without scripts), execute multiple tests in minutes, and carry out in-depth analyzes.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial Intelligence is a technology that will change the future, Artificial intelligence should never be considered a threat to software testing or for jobs because Artificial Intelligence acts as a to improve development works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more and more AI comes into our lives, the need for testing with </span><a href="https://www.aryausa.com/Iot-solution">Artificial intelligence</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is increasing. We have already started to use AI, but we need to continue the testing evolution to achieve efficiency. To know more about <a href="mailto:sales@aryausa.com">sales@aryausa.com</a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote working is a work mode that allows professionals to work outside of a trendy office environment. It is based on the concept that work does not need to be done in a specific location to be carried out successfully. We truly believe working remotely is the best way to take control of your time. Many IT Companies are adopting remote work, <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/how-small-businesses-should-dealing-with-covid-19-outbreak"><strong>Due to the coronavirus outbreak</strong></a>, each company is doing the largest remote work experiment.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, 51 % of employees working in computer/information systems spent part of their time working remotely, according to a Survey report of findings in the workplace. Remote workers could save about $7,000 a year on average per employee, most of those savings come from reducing or eliminating the cost of travel, food, clothing, and child care.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things to Keep in mind, When You are doing Remote Work </span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Gather the complete information or requirement</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re running a remote team you really have to consider the fact that you&#8217;re not meeting each other on a daily basis that could be a reason for failure or to not grow or grow too slowly. The owners spend far too much of their time working on administrative and other tasks rather than concentrating on their actual business. With limited resources in the business, many owners feel that they have to do these many tasks but in fact, they could outsource them to remote assistants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest challenges for a manager is <a href="https://desktrack.timentask.com/blog/build-a-successful-remote-team/">Managing A Remote Team Successfully</a>. If you&#8217;re open to learning, this blog could be helpful to you. Successfully managing a remote team does not need to be stress-filled, frustrating, or headache.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Define Projects</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each project can be divided into multiple segments for different purposes: Planning, Development, Ideas, Marketing, Sales, and many more if you wish. Dividing your projects into multiple modules allows separate teams to focus on what they need. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Create Modules</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each module consists of columns, which makes it easy to organize what&#8217;s to be prioritized and what is in progress. Define your module so that they copy the natural flow of tasks in your organization and work accordingly.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Assign Work</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several team members follow each project led by its leader. He ensures the people to get notified about feedback or task completion.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Daily Basses Communication </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you&#8217;re working remotely, daily bases communication is really important between the partners, by which they can ask each other how they can work on it and can discuss what remote teams need to consider to collaborate successfully. We would cross-check with each other to decide if the prospective client is good for us. In this case, it is necessary to have daily bases interaction between remote workers.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Documentation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documentation is a really important thing in remote work &amp; you can manage your task according to requirements, that will enable your company to be more productive than ever. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. On-Time Delivery</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to make sure your team meets the deadline and their responsibility, to ensure the delivery of the task on time. Create tasks, prioritize them, schedule them, and assign them to your teammates. Build dashboards to identify tasks that are running, pending, or completed. Track status across your to-do lists in real-time.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tools that make your remote work easier</span></h2>
<p>When it comes to remote work, some teams try to handle everything via mail which is especially menacing. <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/productive-tools-that-every-developer-should-know">There are a lot of Productive Tools that you should know</a> about to stay organized while working remotely.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication Tools</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the era of the digital revolution, almost every business needs software/app services. It is hard for every organization to keep a separate software development team with its core team, which causes an increase in operational costs. It is significantly cheaper for companies to outsource these services.</span></p>

<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to small businesses or startups, for their growth they choose <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/custom-software-development">Outsource Software Development Services</a> to reduce the problems, reduce business operating costs and focus on key business goals and plannings. </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing has the potential to give you these significant benefits and can improve your business&#8217;s efficiency, but only when it is used correctly. There are also some remarkable risks in outsourcing software services that can cause your project to fail and can negatively affect your business.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some mistakes that startups must avoid while Outsourcing Software Development Services:-</span></h2>
<h3>Lack of comprehensive analysis:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a startup, you need to be careful in choosing the software development partner you are going to work with. Selecting a Software Development Company without any detailed research is one of the major mistakes that various startups do. While choosing a software development company for your project, a lot of research should be done by your end to make sure that you are partnering with the right company. Some considerations to be included &#8211; company’s portfolio, expertise, feedback &amp; reviews and the working style of your partner in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, after comprehensive and detailed research, it becomes easier for you to identify that the company you choose for your project will deliver your project successfully or not.</span></p>
<h3>Not hiring basic tech expertise at your end</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While outsourcing a software project, a lack of technical knowledge at your end can bring significant <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/reasons-why-outsourcing-sometimes-fails">risks that can cause your outsource project to fail</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After successfully starting a project with your outsourcing partner, regular monitoring is important. If you are not able to handle the project personally you must have to hire an expert or a project manager who can manage the project effectively. </span></p>
<h3>Expecting everything too early</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While outsourcing software development work, one of the major mistakes that startups should avoid is, do not expect everything to be completed too soon. Give your outsourcing partner proper time and flexibility so they can deliver the right product. You have to make sure the work is done at a standard that meets your expectations and business goals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3>Looking at the cost rather than the value</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the major mistakes that startups must avoid is looking at cost rather than product quality. Most of the startups make their outsourcing decision only on the basis of less expensive options and forget about product quality. Although, cost is the most important factor while outsourcing software services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should discuss with the development partner the lowest cost possibilities. Trust them and pay according to the time they invest in your software project.</span></p>
<h3>Not clear with the requirement (What you actually want?)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many times, start-up owners outsource their work without a complete understanding of what needs to be done. It becomes quite difficult to set clear requirements for the outsourcing partner, as well as to evaluate whether the process is going in the right direction or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, before initiating a collaboration you must discuss the requirement. Your outsourcing partner must understand exactly what you want in order to find the most effective ways to implement your idea.</span></p>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>These were the 5 mistakes that startups must avoid when outsourcing a software project. With some best practices like great planning, alignment, and using Project Management Tools, startup companies can survive with these pitfalls that lead outsourced projects to be successful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Artificial Intelligence?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence seemed to be just a science-fiction subject: talking machines, that can think &amp; feel. However, scientists have recently made significant advances in this field of computer science research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning have received much attention. What difference does it make between these two terms, which is quite difficult to understand, and what is the connection between them?</span></p>
<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a branch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.I._Artificial_Intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> science that aims to give machines the ability to “learn”. This is done by using algorithms that identify patterns based on received data; so machines can make decisions and make predictions, that is, become “smart”. In this way, it is no longer necessary for the machine to be programmed specifically for each individual action.</span></p>
<h3><b>Deep Learning</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, it is a branch of Machine Learning Science that represents the most <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AI-Transformation-in-Software-Testing-1-2-1024x576-1.png">advanced field of artificial intelligence</a>. It has the main objective of giving machines the ability to learn and think as much as humans.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Impact of Artificial Intelligence in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Education Sector</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world is changing rapidly around us. As days will increase, it is getting more difficult to keep up with the innovations that could change things as we know it now. The introduction of AI is a step that is creating an empire in technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introducing Al in the educational arena is going to have a profound effect on a continuous area. Now it&#8217;s the right time for educational centers to take advantage of technological advancements and modify their environments accordingly to reach new heights of a productivity booster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI plays a big role in the education sector, AI in the education sector could help teachers to do their jobs better and more efficiently. It creates new adaptive learning techniques, AI has already been making an impact on education. As per the latest trend; there is a high enrollment rate of students for online courses which can be easily managed by using AI technology. AI can help to improve the learning experience. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of AI in the Education Sector </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Simplifying administration process:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  AI manages the administrative processes &amp; tasks easily and manages massive amounts of data to accumulate for the education centers. AI helps to identify and predict risks, automate the services.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Smart learning process:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It will provide smart learning solutions for students, which includes smart learning classrooms, robotics, and smart virtual assistants for students and this is one of the major benefits of smart classroom technology. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Capability to monitor students:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AI will be able to monitor the students in the classrooms without waiting for the exam results to see the student&#8217;s performance. Teachers can get access to see how students are learning their lessons, monitor student&#8217;s activity &amp; progress. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Thoughts </span></h2>

AI is the most reliable part of this segment lies in the automation of almost all kinds of learning resources.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is Embedded Software?</h2>
<p>Embedded software is purpose-built technology designed to carry out specific tasks with optimum efficiency. <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/">Embedded Software outsourcing company</a> is providing the full cycle of embedded software development services for embedded systems and typically involving designing interacting with hardware. like an ex: the embedded system is dedicated to Pacific tasks design engineers can optimize it to reduce the size and product cost and increase reliability and performance.</p>
<h3>Embedded Software is an essential part of the modern technology market.</h3>
<p><strong>Software Development</strong> in India is not something that proceeds in a way that is different from the rest of the world. The reason for this is that skills, trades, and techniques that were initially developed in western countries vis-à-vis technology are now being taught in post-secondary institutions around the world. The software professionals that are now being created worldwide are, at the same time, people that have the same knowledge and skills as people working in countries that can be considered traditional technology hotbeds. India is no exclusion to this rule.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/embed.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2406" src="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/embed.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="528" srcset="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/embed.jpg 800w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/embed-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/embed-768x507.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>For this reason, Aryavrat is passionately devoted to the expansion of <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/agile-methodology-is-a-growing-trend-in-software-development">Hardware and software integration in the embedded system embedded Software development services market in USA</a>. This is actually a lot easier to do in India because of the fact that the technological hub of the country is still in the development stages. In countries like the United States, the technological hub has been developed and is in a constant state of upgrading, which makes it harder to introduce new technologies into the market and have them successfully compete with better versions of old technologies. That problem is not present in India, which is why many of the country’s technological systems are actually embedded systems.</p>
<p>Embedded systems are very specialized, and for that reason can perform a specific task with a high amount of efficiency. When large-scale investment is made, the cost-effective nature of the technology becomes readily apparent.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aryausa.com/custom-software-development">agile model based embedded software development USA</a> has already created many different software packages for embedded systems that do the job of conventional technology in developed countries at a fraction of the monetary and energy input. This trend is only expected to increase as time goes on and India is in the unique position of being the country that is able to lead the rest of the world into this new way of thinking about technology.</p>
<h2>Embedded System key Designing Limitation Challenges:</h2>
<h3>Designing Compiler &amp; Development Challenges:</h3>
<p><strong>Unit Cost:</strong> Monetary Cost of Manufacturing each copy of the system excluding NRE Cost.</p>
<p><strong>NRE Cost (Non-Recurring Engineering Cost):</strong> One Time Monetary Cost of Designing the System.</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Physical Space Required by the system.</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> Security has become a hot topic in the digital world. Related risks grow exponentially, especially for IoT devices that gain popularity worldwide and interconnect with each other. Because Home Appliances are becoming a risk of hacking attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety is a unique feature of embedded systems embedded software as stated by more tough requirements and limitations in terms of quality, testing, and engineering expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility and Integrity:</strong> In the embedded system, many of them lack practical experience in the implementation and updating of their applications in the IoT environment, especially with regard to security implications, which need extreme compatibility throughout the ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Common Issue in Embedded Software Development</h3>
<p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> There are many different ways to connect devices to the Internet. It&#8217;s complicated with a problem, but the problem remains that developers have enough knowledge to understand a problem if something breaks or requires modification.</p>
<p><strong>Debugging:</strong> Debugging is a general issue in embedded systems. Many Hire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_software">Embedded Software</a> Developers express that each embedded project carries an additional cost for debugging that consumes up to 40% of developers&#8217; time.</p>
<h2>Introduction to the integrated software development process and tools:</h2>
<p>Embedded means to combine different features into a single object or system is a way of performing one or multi-task according to a fixed way. Embedded software is a computer system with a dedicated function within a major mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computer limitations.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Editor: 95% Embedded System is Written in C Language. This tool helps you in Writing C codes.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Interpreter: Line by Line translation to machine-executable codes. it can check lines one by one only.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Compiler: uses the complete set of codes this checks the whole code at once when you have a very big program.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Assembler: After it extracts each instruction, it checks how each instruction will work and what it will do.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cross Assembler: for converting object code on cross platforms.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Simulation: To Simulate all functions of or embedded systems.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Source Code Eng. Software: That tool can help to write programs faster along with display to the ability to c++ features.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stethoscope: Dynamically tracking changes in the program.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tracesope: It shows the desired time scale.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Debugger: This is an important tool for testing. Check the code and eliminate errors and errors, notifying the places where they occur.<br />
</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Outcomes of Embedded System</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2009 size-full" src="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/emby-1.jpg" alt="Embedded Software Development" width="799" height="345" srcset="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/emby-1.jpg 799w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/emby-1-300x130.jpg 300w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/emby-1-768x332.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many integrated systems have requirements that differ significantly in both the details and scope of desktop computers. In particular, the demands of the specific application and the interface with external equipment can dominate the system design. In addition, long life cycles and, in some cases, extreme cost sensitivity require more attention to optimization based on these objectives rather than maximizing computational performance.</p>
<p>It is a combination of hardware and software to perform a specific task. This definition is not very clear! Let&#8217;s redefine it. Any electronic system which gives the capability to a device or a machine to perform fully automatic and semi-automatic tasks is an embedded system.</p>
<p>if you are unsure as to the best approach to take with your next embedded project please contact Aryavrat and we can help you make the following decisions:</p>
<p>Hardware choice, from silicon level to complete COTS solutions; Operating system; Application development environment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Information Technology Staffing Management?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the age of information technology and in this age geographical boundaries do not have any interaction on connecting people. These have several advantages and disadvantages. In this age competition in business is also in its swing. To gain an advantage of this IT age and make a business a winner against your competitor you need cost-cutting, that is why advanced companies are starting to hire Offshore IT Staff. A dedicated Offshore IT Staff can effectively handle all your IT works as your in-house staff.

<h3><b>Temporary Jobs</b></h3>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Temporary jobs are often based on the specific or seasonal needs of employers. These are where you work for the staffing companies client on a short-term basis. Temporary jobs can generally be for weeks or months, depending on the position. </span></b></p>
<h3><b>Temp to Hire Jobs</b></h3>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Temp-to-hire jobs are where you work for a staffing company client on a trial basis to determine if you and the client are a good match. If it turns out the job is a good fit for your skills, interests, and career goals. </span></b></p>
<h3><b>Direct Hire Jobs</b></h3>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">it means where you are recruited by the staffing company and then hired by its client. Essentially the staffing company acts as the client’s personal recruiter.  In today’s business era, these agencies hire for just about any job you think of in just about every industry. </span></b></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of the services of a staffing company</span></h2>
<h3>Increase Your Cash Flow</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase your cash flow since you are no longer responsible for workers&#8217; compensation, social security, or unemployment costs, as well as the ability to pay from an invoice instead of issuing many payroll checks.</span></p>
<h3>Cut Your Expenses</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce your expenses by getting relief from recruitment and advertising costs, eliminating paperwork or data processing costs normally related to hiring, paying only for productive time, the ability to change some jobs from fixed to variable expenses, and reducing revenue expenses.</span></p>
<h3>Improve Efficiency</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve efficiency by freeing your Personnel Department to work in other important areas in addition to the laborious task of recruiting, qualifying, testing, and verifying background, references, and employment verifications for each employment opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you look at all the benefits, it is easy to see how it can be an integral part of your team. It&#8217;s like having your own human resources department, but only paying them when you need to use them.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outcomes of Staffing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today&#8217;s business environment more companies use staffing as a management strategy to increase business efficiencies and profitability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staffing provides the flexibility to respond quickly to fluctuating market conditions and demands by supplementing your core employee staff with highly skilled specialists for short and long-term projects.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Search Engine Optimization? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organic SEO or </span>Search Engine Optimization<span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a slow and constant procedure. Reaching the first rankings takes time and link building is an important part of the effort. If you want to have a successful website and get high positions in the search engines, SEO will research your keywords and optimize your site based on the most relevant keywords and drive relevant traffic to your site via the major search engines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first very organic result on the first page of search engine results sees approximately 32.5% of general search traffic in terms of clicks. The second domain sees 17.6% while the seventh only sees 3.5%. The quantity and quality of the links you need will depend on the competitiveness of the keyword phrases for which you are optimizing. More webmasters are focusing on obtaining and quantifying several links quickly, this is bad because it can be considered manipulating search engines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check the guidelines for the search engine you are trying to optimize, this will give you a fantastic idea of ?? what and what not to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One in 5 web users spend 60 sec or less on a web document from a search result; 40% of viewers move on before 3 minutes have elapsed if they do not find the information they need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimizing pages ensure they get directly to the information from their search.</span></p>
<p>55% of users only checked out one result in a search engine. 80% of viewers stopped after 3 results.</p>
<h2>How Search Engine Optimization Helps</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your site is not listed in the top ten, you potentially could lose 80% of your potential buyers. <a href="https://infobloger.medium.com/seo-and-its-important-elements-6d317d1324b7">Search Engine Optimization</a> (SEO) has been the most consistent and efficient form of reaching targeted viewers since the commercialization of the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By getting links from other sites to revolve around link quality. What is the position of the link? Are you aside from many different websites? Does this seem natural and as if it belonged there? These are the questions to ask if you optimize links outside the site. Reciprocal connections are of some importance, but with applications that simplify the process, it seems that it has gone out of control. Also, do you really need a link on these types of low and excellent directory pages? How much value do they include when linking with you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several simple techniques to obtain permanent unidirectional links. Blogs are the most effective first step and can be all you need if your keyword term is not competitive. They can also be a good source of traffic. Advertisers are a reliable source of links edited by humans, they start looking for directories that have a fantastic reputation and are well established. If it can appear in a niche directory to increase its relevance.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we do causes your website to be placed first in the Search Engine</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_marketing"><strong>Search Engine Marketing</strong></a> &#8211; SEM, Search Engine Positioning &#8211; SEP, Search Engine Optimization &#8211; SEO, is the reiterative process of building pathways from your website to Internet searchers and maintaining those pathways. The process requires knowledge of the functionality of your website, the nature of search engines, and more. To successfully market on the internet requires knowledge of over 100 elements that are required to ensure a return on investment. This takes the skills of qualified technicians, marketing experts, SEO professionals, e-metricians (Internet statisticians), and research analysts. It is vital that these experts continually educate themselves on the dynamic nature of search engine optimization.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don&#8217;t know where you are going, we help you to take the right place. </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet marketing plans are a complete blueprint for your website&#8217;s success. These plans include all the elements needed to develop the 3 keys: traffic, usability, continuity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A marketing plan maps out strategies for helping you reach your goals by calculating projections for return on investment. Marketing plans develop stages for website growth and more!</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Challenges in Fleet Management </span></h2>
<h3>Vehicle Acquisition</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vehicle Acquisition may seem like an easy process: you choose the vehicle you want and buy it. The acquisition of vehicles involves a complex variety of decisions, ranging from what types of new vehicles should be purchased, when and from whom, to how that purchase will work for the fleet over time. There are best practices that fleets can follow that will simplify the process and ensure that the company&#8217;s vehicle dollars are well spent.</span></p>
<h3>Fuel Management</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the cost of fuel today fuel theft within company fleets and industry is on the rise, let’s be honest and look at the facts, with today’s prices a few liters of diesel or petrol can be the equivalent of an hour or two of the operator&#8217;s wages, multiply this by a small number of your staff and this can add up to quite a costly sum of money. control the fuel type, vehicle tank size, fuel budgets for each vehicle or piece of plant and equipment in the fleet, you are able to allocate a maximum budget in liters and the time in which that fuel budget is allocated when the time has elapsed the fuel budget is again automatically reset and starts again for each vehicle in the database.</span></p>
<h3>Vehicle Maintenance</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fleet Management is to extract maximum value and minimize the cost of maintaining a large volume of vehicles. This can include inventory control, scheduling of services, maintenance, and expense control. The reporting function of fleet management allows companies to identify operational areas for improvement, institute costs initiatives, and print out detailed accounting summaries for end-of-year financial reporting. Having the right information at the right time assists with government, public, and private fleet management decision-making.</span></p>
<h3>Driver Safety</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping drivers safe on the road is an absolute necessity when it comes to efficient fleet management. Managers should use safety, regulations, and predictive analysis to ensure the safety of drivers, their platforms, and their cargo.</span></p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The call to reduce costs generally comes from the top of the business hierarchy and applies to all departments. When this responsibility falls on the shoulders of the fleet manager. For example, driver reimbursement, tensions with acquisitions created by the exchange of resources, and the cost of the life cycle are affected by external market factors; which further challenges fleet managers seeking to reduce costs.</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing has become an integral part of today’s work culture. As small businesses grow, their managers have increasing needs for help in different types of areas like customer service, production, and IT support. The main reasons companies choose to outsource are to reduce the business operation cost and to offload the <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/4-ways-to-change-the-problem-of-technology-startup">problems that allow them to focus on key business goals and planning</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing can bring big advantages and benefits to the business but there are some significant risks and challenges like lack of communication, high expectations, low quality work, and conflicting interests that cause an outsourced project to fail. To avoid these issues we must have measures <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-building-a-remote-team">advantages and disadvantages of outsourcing</a>, which helps to choose in a better way. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/outsource1-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2035  aligncenter" src="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/outsource1-1.jpg" alt="Outsource-Statistics" width="746" height="652" srcset="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/outsource1-1.jpg 795w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/outsource1-1-300x262.jpg 300w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/outsource1-1-768x671.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Five Reasons Why Outsourcing Sometimes Fails:</span></h2>
<ol>
<li><b> Unrealistic Expectations<br />
</b>One of the big reasons outsourcing fails is higher and unrealistic expectations. Sometimes managers choose the lowest price and expect more output than decided before, this squeezes the provider&#8217;s profit margins and they may look to recoup their losses in any way they can. At last, these things lead the outsourced project to failure.</li>
<li><b>Lack of Communication<br />
</b>If organizations choose to outsource the project offshore, sometimes it will lead to a big issue due to <b><i>lack of communication</i></b><span>. It can occur due to cultural differences, language barriers, and time differences. It means both parties, service providers and clients, are not able to share necessary information actively with each other, and when it comes to time zone differences the organization and their employees must have to work extended hours which will increase the chances of tiredness, bad morale, and working mistakes. Overall, Poor communication can seriously damage the output of a project.</p>
<p></span></li>
<li><b>Conflicting Interests </b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes companies choose to hire a service provider from unusual locations that create differences between the cultures or interests of the outsourcing company and the hiring company. Service providers might be unable to share their interests and understand the way of working of an outsourcing company that can lead an outsourced project to fail.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><b> Poor Performance by Service Provider<br />
</b>Organizations can easily monitor the work of their in-house employees to make sure that they are doing their work properly but when it comes to outsourcing a project their managers operate without direct inspection over the service provider and without checking the quality assurance process. These things give service providers a chance to cut corners in production and provide a poor quality output to the organization that can lead the project outsourcing failure.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li><b> Micromanaging the Service Provider<br />
</b>When outsourcing a project, an organization should have selected the right service provider who has all the necessary skills to perform the work as defined in the contract, it will help managers to tell them what to do. But, Managers should believe that they have the right skills and experience to do so because micromanagement can lead to bad feelings on both sides, lower employee morale, loss of trust, and decreased productivity. So, micromanagement can directly impact the project outcome and will lead to outsourcing failure.</li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These were the 5 areas that managers usually struggle with when outsourcing a project. With some best practices like great planning, alignment, and a better communication process, project management, use of Remote communication, and project management tools, companies can survive with these pitfalls that lead <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/why-outsourcing-is-a-good-option">outsourced projects to be successful</a>.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A<span style="font-weight: 400;">re you an entrepreneur who works on the revolutionary idea, application or the next great startup that will change the world? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many tech startups believe they’re creating the next great thing. In reality, 85% of them failed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the survey, every 2 of 3 startups failed doesn’t matter for which industry they are working. In industry-wise, the IT industry failure rate is higher than any other industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most start-ups fail because they make mistakes, they could have prevented. To overcome these entrepreneurs should be aware of common challenges. Once you’re aware, things will allow you to work on tasks that actually create value.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hat is Technology Startup</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tech startup is a company whose vision is to bring new technology products or services to market or deliver existing technology products or services in new ways.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Technology Startups Fail?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly startup missions fail. Often, the fatal blow is not to hire the right people. The wrong hiring in high growth business costs significantly more than in a slower-growing company. You can literally put your survival at stake when it comes to an executive leadership role.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasons why Startups Failed:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Business Model:- <span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common reason for startup failure is startup founder&#8217;s assuming a brilliant idea is enough to run the business and they don&#8217;t think about customer needs and market study and decisions. That led to this startup&#8217;s failure</span>.</b></li>
<li><b>Poor Management Team or lack of expertise:-<span style="font-weight: 400;"> A common problem that causes startups to fail is poor management and challenges with the development team.<br />
</span></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrepreneurs are unwilling to invest much money in development, initially, they look for a cheap solution and don&#8217;t hire technical expertise. This is the reason for low-quality products. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poor management causes a big failure. That means the team doesn&#8217;t know company needs and by which delays are occurred that also affect product quality.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are usually poor at execution, which leads to issues with the product not getting built correctly or on time, and the go-to-market execution will be poorly implemented.</span></li>
<li><b>Premature Scaling:-<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Premature scaling basically means too much, too soon. Entrepreneurs are in a hurry to scale their product, they are in a hurry to transform their startup into a business. At that point, they are out of order and according to the study, it is the cause of 90% of failed startups.</span></b></li>
<li><b>Running out of cash:- <span style="font-weight: 400;">A fourth major reason that startups fail is that they ran out of cash. The startup runs out of cash because when you start a business, In the early stages of a business, we spend lots of money with no sense. This is a really common mistake, and will just result in a fast burn, and lots of frustration.</span></b></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the survey, 53% of respondents were outsourcing some or all of their IT functions. And more importantly, 31% of companies said that they outsource their IT work to free up internal resources specifically. So, as a result, more than 30% of companies were then better able to focus on their core business goals.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Reasons, Why Organizations Needed To Outsource their work?</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By delegating some of your business processes to an outsider or foreign supplier, You’ll give your in-house employees the opportunity to focus on more meaningful tasks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you stop wasting time on monotonous, time-consuming processes you can give more time and effort to your core offerings which mean </span><a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/agile-methodology-is-a-growing-trend-in-software-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accelerating Business Processes</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main reasons is that it </span>Reduces cost; outsourcing<span style="font-weight: 400;"> means saving money. This is often due to lower labor costs, cheaper infrastructure, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing provides </span>flexibility<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the customer because vendors have multiple resources and capabilities available to them, while internal staff may have limited resources.</span></li>
</ul>

Which means lower salaries, as well as lower infrastructure and operational costs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Significant time savings: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing allows you to manipulate far more responsibilities than you would be able to address with a basic internal staff by letting someone more experienced or knowledgeable handle work. It eliminates all very time-consuming activities for an eg. interview, select, and train new in-house employees, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Faster Results: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing work, it becomes easy, as part of the burden is shared by the outsourcing partner. This enables to work with new clients and take on new projects without having to spend time on each project. And also helps in faster delivery of the products, ideas, and concepts into the competitive market.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-971" src="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iterative-development1-300x159.png" alt="Agile strategies" width="321" height="170" /></span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why we need Agile over traditional approaches:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first generation involved a typical waterfall model or waterfall methodology developed in the lines of scientific management.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was followed by a set of new SDLC methodologies, incorporating an element of tolerance for change by introducing incremental and iterative development approaches and their combination.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenges faced in the previous software development methodologies led to the evolution of agile development methods</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous software development methodologies, such as the cascade model, only interactive and/or only incremental approaches, provided structure to the chaotic software development process, and the gains were in the form of predictability and efficiency. Another byproduct of these structured software development methods was the increase in bureaucracy and delays.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile Methodology? – learn new strategies.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name suggests, a person who learns about what is agile methodology needs to understand the fact that this methodology makes it possible for the products from the company to be subjected to market conditions before the product reaches its final stage so that the shortcomings in the product are brought to light at the earliest and then steps are taken to rectify them so that the technique of agile methodology increases the profits of the company. Thus, it is needless to say that companies that wish to be at the top need to learn as to what is agile methodology.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile Methodologies Principles</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery</span></li>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Simplicity</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Self-organizing teams</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kanban Methodology</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kanban is a visual project management framework derived from the lean software development process and used in agile project management. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kanban method aims to reduce waste, continuously improve the process, and increase overall productivity.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aim of using Kanban is to remove bottlenecks during the production process so that the project can flow smoothly and still be kept within budget.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of Kanban</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clear communication and transparency</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexibility</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responsive to demand</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus and collaboration </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">When to use Kanban?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kanban is the foremost approach in project development cycles that require continuous improvement in gradual increments and by which teams can accomplish work in just-in-time productions. The Kanban approach helps teams have a visual idea of what is going on in the project and what is next to come.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which One to Use?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile methodology is an effective process for product development. But it is important to understand the type of organizations, project category, team size, etc before adopting the project development approach.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While choosing Scrum vs Kanban keep in mind if you need a more structured approach and the requirement is specific, Scrum is a good option.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if the customer is flexible for product improvement continuously and the pattern is not fixed, kanban more likely option.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rapid growth of the Internet of things has caused reliability, compatibility, and effectiveness in the IT industry in several ways. IoT is undoubtedly the next big thing in technology and has a core relationship with Artificial intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI is expected to perform several intelligent tasks (like speech recognition, decision-making, language understanding, etc.). It is believed to perform tasks that were earlier limited to human intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the Internet of Things (IoT) refers to devices that are interrelated and transfer data over a network. IoT devices do not require a computer or human interaction devices and are already made a debut in daily lifestyle products across the world. IoT devices rely heavily on Internet connectivity.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_of_things">Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI) is an offshoot of computer science that studies intelligent systems (i.e. software, computers, robots, etc.). Alternatively, it can be defined as &#8220;the study and design of intelligent agents&#8221; where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Artificial Intelligence (AI) </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the amount of data that is generated, by both humans and machines, far outpaces humans’ ability to absorb, interpret, and make complex decisions based on that data. <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-and-its-challenges-with-solution">Artificial intelligence</a> forms the basis for all computer learning and is the future of all complex decision-making. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the Internet of Things (IoT)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; has come to describe a series of technologies and research disciplines that allow the Internet to reach the real world of physical objects. Technologies such as RFID, short-range wireless communications, real-time location, and sensor networks are now becoming increasingly common, bringing the Internet of Things to commercial use. They foreshadow an exciting future that closely intertwines the physical world and cyberspace, a development that is not only relevant for researchers but also companies and individuals.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why the Internet of Things (IoT)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the initial stages of the development of the Internet have profound implications for the technology industry, the implications of the </span><a href="https://www.aryausa.com/Iot-solution">IoT Automation Solutions</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IoT) will prove to be of greater scope since, due to their inherent characteristics, it is a movement that we believe will be more beyond technology to impact all industries. </span></p>
<h2><b>Artificial Intelligence Plays an Important Role In IoT Revolution</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a clear cross between the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). IoT is about connecting machines and making use of the data generated from those machines. AI is about simulating intelligent behavior on machines of all kinds. An overlay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT allows the flow of data between devices and AI can help to make sense of this data. AI is expected to be the key propellant to the growth of the IoT revolution and take it to a new level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data is only useful if you create an action. To make the data processable, they must be complemented with context and creativity. The </span><a href="https://www.aryausa.com/get-in-touch">AI ​​, ML, and IoT</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are in this context, that is, &#8216;connected intelligence&#8217; and not just connected devices.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>What is Blockchain Technology</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A <strong>blockchain</strong> carries no transaction cost. (An infrastructure cost yes, but no transaction cost.) It is a simple way of passing information from A to B in a fully automated and safe manner. That is quite revolutionary because it allows us to keep it track records of pretty much anything we can think of (to name some: property rights, identities, money balances, medical records), without being at risk of someone tampering with those records. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Why Blockchain Technology </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blockchain-development-company">Custom Blockchain Technology Development Services</a>, you can achieve effective and faster-automated transaction processing, greater security, simplified document maintenance, and reduced operational costs. By allowing digital information to be distributed but not copied, blockchain technology created the backbone of a new type of internet. Originally devised for the Medical, Agriculture, Logistics, Cryptocurrency,  (Buy cryptocurrency) the tech community has now found other potential uses for the technology. This Technology keeps growing fast and is still growing at a rapid pace.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basic Pillars of Blockchain Platforms:</span></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Decentralize apps Development:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Before Bitcoin and BitTorrent came to besides, we were more used to centralized services. The idea is very easy. You have a centralized entity that stored all the data and you’d have to interact only with this entity to get whatever information you required. decentralize system have no core authority to detect the truth to other participants in the other network. every participant in the network can access the history of transactions or confirm new transaction.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Customized Blockchain Development:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In simple terms, we can say, the blockchain is an innovative distributed ledger that stores data and assures its integrity. By using a various set of cryptography-based technologies, blockchain make sure that transactions and data added into the database are immutable. As so global perspective like</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cryptocurrency, Medical, Agriculture, Logistics, and some more. It is a standout amongst the most secure innovations that right now exist since it has characterized monetary tenets and an unmistakable procedure for confirming exchanges.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>DLT Solutions:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Full scale of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) in one company together with a multi-skilled team of technologists, developers, and advisors. DLT is basically a database of records that are shared among many distrusting parties. To conclude, Blockchain and DLT both implement a ‘distributed ledger’ and have ordinary foundation principals. Each implementation is very specific, and it is extremely difficult to compare one with the other because of the nature and purpose of the implementation.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Custom Coins, Tokens &amp; Wallets Development:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Crypto coins are trouble the global financial industry, reinventing the way we transact. Reducing the settlement time, eliminating the middleman and boosting the security quotient, <strong>c</strong></span><strong>ryptocurrencies</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have established themselves as a cornerstone of more secure, quick and transparent deals.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outcomes of Blockchain Technology:</span><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2070" src="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/blockchaintechnologi_LT7gb.jpg" alt="Blockchain Technologies" width="305" height="244" srcset="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/blockchaintechnologi_LT7gb.jpg 500w, https://www.aryausa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/blockchaintechnologi_LT7gb-300x240.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This technology could be quite complementary in a possibility space for the future world that includes the two centralized and decentralized models. Like any new technology, it is an idea that initially interrupts, and over time it could promote the development of a larger ecosystem that includes a pair of old ways and the new innovation in blockchain technology. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain Development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is helping every business get into the space of decentralization. We are helping small businesses successfully deploy decentralized and flawless infrastructure support. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobile App Development<span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the set of processes and procedures used to write software for small, wireless computing devices such as smartphones or tablets, One way to ensure that applications show optimum performance on any given device was to develop the app. Now let&#8217;s take a look at our following Mobile Application Services.</span></p>
<h2>What is Native Application:<span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native App is a software or program that is developed to perform specific tasks on a particular platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can provide optimized performance and take advantage of the latest technology, such as a GPS, compared to web apps or mobile cloud apps on specific tools and platforms. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These apps are written in the code prior to use for the device and its operating system and provide fast performance &amp; a high degree of reliability. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Native ios:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native apps are written in the code prior to use for the device and its Operating System. e.g. developers write iOS applications in ( Swift or Objective-C )</span></span></span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Native Android: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native Android Apps Written in Java or Kotin. In Android, there are several choices but ultimately Android Studio is the best.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Hybrid Application<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
<p><b>C</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">onsidered as a combination of native app and web app, a hybrid app is built-in as a single app that works across various operating systems like Windows, Android, and iOS. It is developed with CSS, HTML5, and JavaScript. A hybrid app can be built for any platform from a single code base.</span></p>
<p><b>React Native App: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">React Native is an interesting framework that allows web developers to create robust mobile applications using their existing JavaScript knowledge. It offers quick </span><a href="https://www.aryausa.com/mobile-app-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mobile App Development Services in USA</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and more efficient code sharing across iOS, Android.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">React Native Similar frameworks are Ionic and Xamarin.</span></p>
<h2>Why Native App:</h2>
<ol>
<li><b style="font-size: 16px;">Flawless Performance:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In the process of native application development, the coding is done for various platforms utilizing various programming languages specific to every operating system.<br />
</span></span></span></span></li>
<li><b> Supreme Speed:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Native apps have Supreme speed and performance as they are optimized for iOS and Android OS. The development process considers every single thing; Including the use of the battery and the memory of the smartphones.</span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Magnificent User Experience: </b>The study says, 79% of consumers try any app either once or twice if it failed in the first attempt; while only 16% of the users would give it more than two attempts. Thus mobile apps should create a good impression on the users; to ensure that it does not get deleted after installation<br />
</span></span></span></li>
<li><b> User Data Protection: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excellent efficiency of hardware resources is present in native apps, providing protection and security of user data with complete reliability.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><b> Flexibility: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native apps are enough flexible to deliver fast access to various inbuilt device utilities, such as calendar, camera, microphone, GPS, etc. of the smartphones.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>Drawbacks of Native Apps:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Slow Development Process:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Native apps are built to be suitable for various platforms, separate development effort is needed for creating and implementing the design for every device dimension in a particular platform.</span></span></span></span></li>
<li><b>Costly:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Native Apps each platform code has its individual release cycle and updates. besides, to develop and maintain the same app on other platforms, you will need specialized proficiency for a particular platform. This growing the development cost.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Why Hybrid App:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Cost-effective Development: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hybrid Development can be done at once for all kinds of platforms. There is no need to hire a different programmer for each platform. Thus the development effective cost reduces.</span></span></span></span></li>
<li><b>Low Maintenance Needed: </b>Considered as a web app incorporated in a native shell. You can update the hybrid app as many times according to your need or preference. It runs without much maintenance.</li>
<li><b>Work across multiple platforms</b><b>: </b>Hybrid apps can run both Android &amp; iOS having just one codebase. The cross-platform capabilities may become the deciding factor for many stakeholders making a choice between native or hybrid apps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Drawbacks of Hybrid Apps</h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><b>Untimely</b><b> User Experience:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hybrid apps cannot deliver an equally seamless user experience across all the platforms.</span></span></span></span></li>
<li><b>An issue in Debugging:</b> Its source code and targeted on a mobile platform, specifically the hybrid mobile frameworks. This layer can make debugging processes problematic. To avert such issues.</li>
<li><b>Deteriorate</b><b> Performance: </b>In React Native, when it comes to 3D or HD games, high-graphics-based apps there’s a possibility that the hybrid approach may not go well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Conclusion </strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fight between native and hybrid apps is continuous. Both have their own pros and cons and so to get a final outcome is a difficult task.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you head for anything it is always advisable to take a bit of time and think about what you prefer more. Cross-platform, feasible, one-source code, easy updates, time and money saver; all these make Hybrid the best but, in the long run, they may put you into trouble.<br />
While Native ones are though time-consuming and costly. They offer the best security, user experience, and smooth access to all native APIs. Your higher investment of money and time won’t go to waste in the native apps.</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to building interactive web applications, </span>ReactJS<span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a well-established framework and a popular choice among developers. But what about its competitors? The two main ones are Angular and Vue, both robust frameworks that come with their own strengths and weaknesses. Let’s look at how these other frameworks shape up next to ReactJS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(web_framework)">React </a>is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces for web applications. Developed and maintained by Facebook, it is used by many well-known online businesses such as Netflix, Airbnb, Dropbox, and Microsoft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework)">Angular </a>is a cross-platform JavaScript MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) framework for building interactive web applications. Developed and maintained by Google, it is also used by a variety of major online businesses such as Upwork, Paypal, and Udemy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vue.js">Vue</a> is a JavaScript framework that aims to be more approachable, versatile, and performant than its competitors. A relatively new challenger, it is growing rapidly in popularity. It was created by Evan You, an ex-Google developer who worked on Angular wanting to create a better, more lightweight framework. It is used by Alibaba, Grammarly, and Adobe, amongst others.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Performance and Capability</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">React is a very performant, flexible, and responsive framework, particularly due to being heavily JavaScript-based. It features a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) which makes updating the application as a result of changes in data and state more performant. It also supports native development with </span><b>React Native</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Angular</strong> is very performant with similar characteristics to React, although for large, data-heavy applications it can be significantly slower. This is because it features two-way data binding between source and view, whereas React and Vue are one-way. Two-way data binding also makes it more difficult to debug errors in the application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Vue</strong> is a very flexible and modular framework that makes it easier to develop a wide range of different applications. Like React, it features a virtual DOM to improve performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All these frameworks are component-based, which means that developers can create small, versatile components that can be combined in different ways to produce complex UIs.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning Curve</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications written with React are written in JSX, a syntax extension to </span><b>JavaScript</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which requires developers to have JavaScript knowledge. Because it is a very flexible framework, it is also one which offers little structural guidance for developers when creating an application. Due to its depth, it takes a relatively long time to master and requires competence in integrating user interfaces into an MVC framework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Angular</strong> is much more opinionated on how an application should be structured, which makes it easier to grasp. However, it offers a fatiguing number of tools for developers to learn, as well as requiring developers to use TypeScript, which is relatively niche compared to JavaScript and is, therefore, less dependable as a long-term choice for companies. Angular is also more bloated in features compared to its counterparts, which results in a significant learning curve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Vue</strong> is the easiest and most approachable of the three, and some companies have switched to it specifically because of how easy it is for new developers to learn. Its syntax is based on HTML which is easier to learn than JavaScript. It also features compatibility with React’s JSX. In order to allow developers to take advantage of the more powerful JavaScript when necessary.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Development and Support</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because <strong>React</strong> is backed and used by Facebook, it is very well maintained with frequent updates, and being open-source, many programmers from all over the world contribute to the codebase. Because of its widespread popularity, there is a range of resources and learning materials through Q&amp;A sites, blogs, and guides, making it easier for new developers to get up to speed. Facebook is also developing the next generation of React called React Fibre, which will be 100% backward compatible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Angular</strong> is backed and used by Google and comes with comprehensive documentation as well as a variety of learning materials and tutorials. Angular is a recent evolution of AngularJS, the framework originally released in 2010. This means that Google is hard at work improving Angular and making it a better choice for developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.aryausa.com/blog/what-is-software-development-and-maintenance"><strong>Development and Maintenance</strong></a> of <strong>Vue</strong> are led by Evan You, who has a small team of engineers developing the framework, relying on sponsorships and donations. Despite these humble beginnings, Vue is growing very fast and is already experiencing strong uptake with new companies and developers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The choice of framework for your project depends on the specific requirements of the project; the skills you have on your team. Despite differences in the way that applications are developed in these three frameworks. All are robust and performant options that are well worth considering.

Many other apps, including Mail, Safari and Notes, allow you to copy something and paste it to PrinterShare for printing. Note: the app is free to try, but actual printing requires payment.</p>
<p>USING PRINTERS</p>
<p>Many WiFi-capable printers are detected automatically. PrinterShare can print to these printers directly.</p>
<p>Any other printer will work too, as long as it&#8217;s visible from a Windows or Mac computer. Download client software for that computer from www.printershare.com. PrinterShare will find clients in the same WiFi network automatically and use the printer through them.</p>
<p>Also, you can use printers anywhere in the world over Internet. This requires the same client software installed on receiving end, and registration on PrinterShare web server.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><strong>ClassicBoy (Emulator)</strong> &#8211; it emulates a bunch of systems all in one app. Some of the included emulators are SNES, PSX, GameBoy Advance and Color, NES, and Sega. It seems to work generally well but there are some titles that the emulator is not made for and thus has a lower game compatibility than a specific game emulator would.</li>
<li><strong>DraStic DS Emulator</strong> &#8211; It supports a huge number of games and has good controls and menu options. It isn’t totally complete just yet, but in terms of features, smooth game play, and ROM compatiblity, this is about as good as you can get.</li>
<li><strong>FPse for Android</strong> &#8211; It’s always been hotly debated on which PlayStation emulator was the best. Many say that ePSXe is the best but if you want full control, all the options, and the best overall experience, FPse wins out.</li>
<li><strong>John GBC (GBC Emulator)</strong> &#8211; If you were more of a handheld console person, there are some great emulators out there for you too. To start, John GBC which is a Game Boy and Game Boy Color emulator. It’s highly rated, stable, and has the best ROM compatibility.</li>
<li><strong>MD.emu</strong> &#8211; It is actually quite difficult to find a good Sega Genesis emulator on Android but MD.emu fits the bill. This one is an open-source Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Sega CD, and Master System/Mark III emulator that pretty much covers all of the early Sega years.</li>
<li><strong>MegaN64 N64 Emulator</strong> &#8211; The emulator crowd on Android was begging for a functioning N64 emulator and they finally got one. It’s not perfect and there are some minor graphical glitches here and there, but it’s the most complete N64 emulator you can get right now. It’s also based on the popular Mupen64 so if you liked that one, this one is pretty similar. Also, it’s free (with ads) and free stuff is awesome.</li>
<li><strong>GBA Emulator</strong> &#8211; In terms of pure Google Play ratings, My Boy is the highest rated on the list. It’s incredibly stable with great compatibility and a lot of options. This includes the fast forward control so you can speed through slow parts of the game.</li>
<li><strong>My Boy! &#8211; GBA Emulator</strong> &#8211; My Boy! is a super fast and full-featured emulator to run GameBoy Advance games on the broadest range of Android devices, from very low-end phones to modern tablets. It emulates nearly all aspects of the real hardware correctly</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Asphalt 8: Airborne</h2>
<p style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Asphalt 8: Airborne is our favorite racing game on mobile right now. It skips all pretensions of realism and provides an over-the-top, high-octane game with all the fixings. Players can work (or pay) their way through the career mode, unlock new rides, upgrade the ones they have, or take the competition online in staggered or live multiplayer. The usual race modes are there, plus a new &#8216;Infected&#8217; one where players have to tag other racers before succumbing to an explosive virus.</p>
<h2>Beach Buggy Blitz</h2>
<p style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Beach Buggy Blitz is a fun, easy-going racing game where players cruise along the coast of a tropical beach, trying to hit progressive checkpoints before the timer runs out. Gathering coins along the way helps fund your buggy upgrades, but make sure to avoid the various huts, animals, and fellow racers strewn about the course &#8211; impacts will slow you down.</p>
<h2>CSR Racing</h2>
<p style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">CSR Racing is a clean-cut drag racing game. Players needn’t worry about steering &#8211; all you have to do is perfectly time your gear changes. Indicators tell when to make your next shift, and assuming your timing is up to snuff and your ride is amply upgraded, you should pull across the finish line before your opponent, and earn some winnings. Premium currency can be used to buy high-end cars, while the standard currency can be used to buy the others, as well as upgrade specific parts such as the gear box, engine, intake, and body.</p>
<h2>Death Rally</h2>
<p style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Death Rally is a gritty, combat-heavy top-down racing title. Players deck out their ride with all manner of Mad Max-style weaponry and eliminate competitors in races and straight-up death matches. Weapon parts litter every battlefield, as well as cash bonuses and nitro speed boosts. The nice thing about Death Rally is that even if you don’t place first in a race, you can still walk away with a fair bit of cash just from blowing up opponents.</p>
<h2>Fast &amp; Furious 6</h2>
<p style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Fast &amp; Furious 6 is a drag racing game draws inspiration from the popular action movies. Players shift gears at just the right time to pull ahead of rivals, and climb through the ranks, both in single-player and online races. Winnings are spent on upgrading rides to take on bigger and badder challenges. What really sets Fast &amp; Furious apart from other drag racing games is the drifting mini-game, whereby players have to hold and release a drift button within specific target zones to keep the best time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>FlightTrack</strong></p>
<p>Follow the path of thousands of international flights on slick, zoomable maps, with detailed information on departure gates, delays and (heaven forbid) cancellations. Great for those anticipating the arrival of loved ones, or particularly nerdy train-spotters looking to up their game.</p>
<h3>Entrain</h3>
<p>There are plenty of theories floating about concerning the best methods for beating jetlag, but the pointy heads at The University of Michigan are better placed than most to give scientific counsel. Three cheers, then, for their quirky app, which takes your travel dates and destination and dispenses advice on how to adapt your circadian cycle in advance by optimizing lighting levels throughout your day.</p>
<h3>Air Sharing</h3>
<p>In the cut-throat world of business, time is money, making a seven-hour trans-Atlantic flight a lot of Wonga indeed. Thankfully, just because your laptop’s packed away doesn’t mean you can’t keep your eyes on the prize.</p>
<h3>Skyscanner</h3>
<p>This clean-looking solution does everything you’d ever need it to, aggregating fares from airlines and the big travel sites to bag you the best deal. For those really keeping an eye on the purse-strings, there’s also the option to pin your search to your start screen and keep an eye on price fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Airbnb</h3>
<p>The all-conquering database for user-provided accommodation extends its tentacles into your Smartphone, with an app that effectively serves as a pocket-sized version of the website.</p>
<h3>AA Parking</h3>
<p>There are stacks of apps out there that’ll show you a map of nearby car parks, but for UK residents none does so in as much detail as this market-leading marvel. As well as tracking down spaces in their vicinity, users can also see at a glance how much they’ll have to pay to stay per hour and, for some car parks, the exact number of spaces available.</p>
<h3>Maplets</h3>
<p>Google Maps and CityMapper do a fine job of orienting you down streets and toward landmarks, but even they have their blank spots. Which is where Maplets comes in? Essentially a gigantic database of specialized maps – some official, others created by users</p>
<h3>Foodspotting</h3>
<p>While apps that aggregate crowd-sourced restaurant reviews may be ten-a-penny, those that focus in on specific dishes are a far rarer species. Luckily, this one works a treat, responding to your every gastronomic whim with user-generated recommendations from your local area.</p>
<h3>Google Translate</h3>
<p>Another Google product, another market cornered. As far as general translation apps go, this is unbeatable: it boasts enough features to sate all but the most pedantic linguists, and a few bonuses too. Particularly intriguing is the Word Lens tool, whereby you point your camera at a foreign word, which is then translated in real time on your screen – great, unless you’re caught trying to decipher a ‘No Cameras’ sign.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><strong>iTunes</strong>&#8211; It&#8217;s been around forever (in tech time, more than 10 yearsis forever) and has revolutionized music listening and music buying. It&#8217;s so basic, most of us don&#8217;t give iTunes a second thought. Butit&#8217;s a powerful software application that lets you acquire, manage and listen to music. Approximately 70 percent of the music downloaded in the U.S. is purchased through the iTunes Store [source: Keizer].</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Cloud Player</strong>&#8211; Music listeners get two bonuses from cloud computing. First, because the song files are stored in the &#8220;clouds&#8221; &#8212; that is, on remote computers &#8212; space on your computer or mobile device is freed up. Second, cloud storage means that you can access your favorite tunes from<br />
any of your devices at any time. You can also synch your music with all your devices instantly</li>
<li><strong>Rdio</strong>&#8211; Music is inherently social. People make music together. Friends share tunes, follow bands, attend concerts, groove to the same songs. Apps that incorporate social media and music are extremely popular. Rdio is a paid service that gives you access to streaming song tracks and playlists from a library of 8 million tunes.</li>
<li><strong>Pandora</strong>&#8211; Pandora is one of the original Internet radio apps. The &#8220;stations&#8221; are actually custom music streams tailored to your choice of artist and genre. Pandora lets you listen to specific songs or artists, create playlists and find new tunes. Pandora&#8217;s software draws on and analyses a huge<br />
database of tunes to keep presenting you with new music based on your favourites and your listening patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Spotify</strong>&#8211; The Spotify streaming music service started in Europe, but has been steadily expanding its reach to more regions. Spotify offers a truly enormous library of more than 15 million tracks. And it shoots them to your mobile device at 320 Kbps, a higher rate than some other services &#8212; the<br />
result is better sound quality. With premium service, there are no ads, and you can access exclusive content like pre-release tracks.</li>
<li><strong>Slacker Radio</strong>&#8211; Slacker is another Internet radio service. It has apps for iPhone, Android, BlackBerry and Palm. Like Pandora, Slacker creates custom stations that play music of a certain type. But for a fee, Slacker also gives you unlimited access on demand to the music or artists you choose</li>
<li><strong>Last.fm</strong>&#8211; Last.fm is a major music streaming service. Its claim to fame is its ability to help you find music that&#8217;s likely to be just what youwere looking for. Last.fm tracks what you listen to on Internet and your various mobile devices, then recommends new music just for you. Last.fm is available foriPhone, Xbox, iPod Touch, Android and Windows Phone 7.</li>
<li><strong>Grooveshark</strong> &#8211; Grooveshark is another streaming music app, but with a twist. Besides listening to preset stations, you can create and modify your playlist. You can also upload your own music into the Grooveshark library and add that to the stream you&#8217;re listening to, and access your tunes on mobile devices using Grooveshark Anywhere. The mobile app is currently available for Android, Palm,</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Spotify </strong>&#8211; Spotify requires a subscription, right? No, wait. It is free. Sort of. Spotify now comes with a stripped-down playlist/radio combo for users who don&#8217;t pay for the service but still want to use it on mobile, accompanied by a swish new tablet interface that has much more in common with the free desktop browser player. So yes, it&#8217;s free. Hobbled a bit, but free.The premium version drops the annoying adverts, ups the audio quality and provides additional features such as offline play, so it&#8217;s worth splashing out for the subscription if you use the service often.</p>
<p><strong>Strava</strong> &#8211; If you&#8217;re serious about running or cycling then you should be serious about Strava. As smartphone fitness tools go it&#8217;s one of the best, allowing you to track your performance, set goals and see daily progress updates.There are leader boards and challenges to give it a competitive edge and if you&#8217;re ever not sure where to run or cycle you can find user created routes on the app, or share your own. All of that comes free of charge, while a premium version adds even more tools.</p>
<p><strong>Pushbullet </strong>&#8211; If you spend a lot of time at a computer and don&#8217;t want to dig your phone out every time it vibrates then Pushbullet could be the app for you. Download it to your phone and get the extension for your browser and any notifications that appear on your handset will also appear on your computer screen.So not only will your calendar reminders pop up but you&#8217;ll also be able to see who&#8217;s texting or calling and decide whether it&#8217;s worth replying before you ever look at your phone. You can even reply to texts from your computer and you can easily mute notifications from apps which you&#8217;re not interested in seeing.</p>
<p><strong>Periscope</strong> &#8211; Periscope, Twitter&#8217;s live video streaming app, has made its way to Android and it&#8217;s an essential download for anyone who likes the immediacy of Twitter but craves something more visual.You can easily create your own live streams or watch other people&#8217;s, send comments and hearts in real time and if you miss the action there&#8217;s a 24 hour window with which to replay streams. In short it&#8217;s simple enough to dive straight into but has enough to it that you&#8217;ll keep coming back, whether you&#8217;re more creator or viewer.</p>
<p><strong>WhatsApp</strong> &#8211; The instant messaging behemoth WhatsApp is an essential Android install, especially if you can convince the people you message most frequently to use it too.The concept is simple &#8211; it takes over text messaging on your mobile, routing messages through any Wi-Fi connection instead. Which means no more SMS allowances, no size restrictions, plus images are sent at a decent resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Evernote</strong> &#8211; Evernote is the original and the best note-taking app. It allows you save ideas for that book you are always nearly about to write, syncs across devices and you can also create to-do lists, record voice reminders and capture photos straight from the app. It&#8217;s a seamless way to organize your probably very messy life.</p>
<p><strong>Instagram</strong> &#8211; Instagram is the go-to app for quickly taking photos, adding quirky filters to them and sharing them with the world. Over 300 million people use Instagram and thanks to the social aspects and effortless interface it&#8217;s easy to see why it&#8217;s such a hit.You&#8217;re not limited to sharing your snaps on Instagram either, as you can easily add your photos to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more with just a few taps.</p>
<p><strong>Timehop</strong> &#8211; &#8211; For the most part, social media is fleeting, but Timehop is all about digging up precious memories from the past. You link it to whatever social media services you frequent (and your on-device photos) and it shows you what was happening years ago on today&#8217;s date.</p>
<p><strong>Pocket </strong>&#8211; Even in 2015 there are still times and places where we can&#8217;t get an internet connection, but this doesn&#8217;t have to mean you can&#8217;t read websites, however, thanks to the excellent pocket app. It allows you to save articles, news stories, blog posts, videos and much more, letting you read and watch them offline.You can also synchronize your saved articles across every device you&#8217;ve installed Pocket on, allowing you to pick up where you left off and continue reading.</p>

<p>• BRING PHOTOS TO LIFE: Google Photos can automatically create montage movies, interactive stories, collages, animations, panoramas and more from your photos. Or you can easily create them yourself – just tap +.</p>
<p>• EDITING: Transform photos with the tap of a finger. Use simple, yet powerful, photo and video editing tools to apply filters, adjust colours and more.</p>
<p>• SHARING: Instantly share up to 1,500 photos with anyone – no matter what device they’re on – just by sending a link. Just select photos, tap the share icon, then tap Copy Link.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Action Launcher has long been a favorite of our readers and it deserves a spot on this list.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><strong>Action Launcher</strong> &#8211; Action Launcher has long been a favorite of our readers and it deserves a spot on this list. It comes with a stock Android kind of look but with several unique features baked in. Some of these include Quick theme which uses your background to determine the theme accents, Covers which is a unique take on folders, Quick page which is like a hidden home screen you can access almost anywhere, and plenty more.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apex launcher</strong> &#8211; Apex Launcher has been around for a very long time and remains one of the most iconic Android launchers ever. Like Action Launcher, it aims to give a stock Android look and feel with a few extra features thrown in for good measure. Among those include the ability to alter things like transition animations, scrolling habits, and there is even a scrolling dock where you can lay plenty of icons.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buzz launcher</strong> &#8211; Buzz Launcher is an intensely popular launcher with a different kind of theming. Buzz Launcher utilizes something called Home packs which allows you to not only customize and theme your home screen, but actually change the entire home screen itself.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>CM launcher</strong> &#8211; Despite it’s name, CM Launcher has actually no ties to CyanogenMod whatsoever. The app is done by the same developers who did CM Security which adorns our best Android Antivirus apps listright now. The app focuses on creating the smallest conceivable footprint and the download itself is only 2MB and uses only a small amount of system resources. It’s a light, fast, and stable launcher.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Go launcher</strong> &#8211; GO Launcher is among the most popular Android launchers out there with well over 100 million installs to date. This is likely thanks to its simplicity and extensive theming options.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google launcher</strong> &#8211; Google Now Launcher is the the go-to launcher for fans of Google and Android. It is essentially the stock launcher experience with built-in Google Now. It features simplicity, “Okay, Google” hot word integration, translucent theming elements, and more.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nova launcher</strong> &#8211; It doesn’t get too much better than Nova Launcher. Like Apex Launcher, Nova has been around since “the good old days” and remains not only relevant, but one of the best Android launcher app options available. It has a laundry list of customizable features that include gesture support, the ability to customize the look and feel of the app, icon pack support, themes, and much, much more.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Nowadays our smart phones are providing a lot of functions.  but they don’t prove endless battery power. Many people face problem with their phone’s battery .There are some battery saving tips to make your battery life longer.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Android has a lot of communicative functions which should be turned off when you are not using them. These include Bluetooth, WIFI, GPS, NFC and much more. Keeping it off can save a lot of battery energy.</li>
<li>Turn off auto-syncing for Google accounts. If you don&#8217;t need every single Google account updated every fifteen minutes, just go into your Settings and Google account and turn off auto-sync for those apps you don&#8217;t need constantly updated.</li>
<li>If you are concerned about your phone’s battery life, don’t allow all the apps to update automatically. Manually update the app when its convenient for you.</li>
<li>Use power saving mode, if you have it. This control CPU usage and screen power and can squeeze extra battery hour upto12.</li>
<li>Stop the apps that are running in the background. Check all the running apps from setting – APPS, SWIPE TO THE LEFT; and stop the apps that are unnecessary.</li>
<li>Turn down the brightness and set your phone’s brightness to automatic mode.</li>
<li>Remove all the widgets that are on home screen and even not useful. As well live wallpapers and themes etc also consume a lot of battery.</li>
<li>Turn off the notifications of Facebook, twitter, Email etc if you do not need to be constantly updated.</li>
<li>Always use original battery. Other battery can damage in your phone.</li>
<li>If you get lots of notifications on your phone use lock screen notification. Because you can see all your notifications on lock screen at a glance without having to turn your whole screen on.</li>
<li>Turn off smart features like air gestures, smart scrolling and the like, especially if you have a Samsung. Unless you really use these features every day, they&#8217;re just using battery power for a feature you don&#8217;t use.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The first and most obvious difference between iPhone and Android is the plethora of devices and its accessories available with Android. Due to this factor android devices are cheaper and more preferable than iPhone.. As a result there are far more Android phones out there to choose.</li>
<li>When you have an Android phone, your notifications are always displayed at the top of the screen. Notification drags user’s attention to check it.</li>
<li>Android does not force you to keep all your apps on Home screen as iPhone do.</li>
<li>You can customize your phone easily as compared to iPhone.</li>
<li>Android provides many ways to his users to lock his phone like pattern lock or face lock. But iPhone provide only passcode or fingerprint lock only.</li>
<li>Apple’s baked-in maps isn’t good as Google maps. But you can’t make Google maps your default.</li>
<li>You can set multiple accounts at same Android tablet.</li>
<li>Google’s app store allows you to download apps directly from its website. But when you search any iPhone app from browser, you will need to launch iTunes or App store to download the app.</li>
<li>With iPhone it is necessary to use Apple’s proprietary “Lightning“cable. But with Android you can use any micro USB.</li>
<li>Android doesn’t care where your music comes from. But you need iTunes if you want to load up your phone with songs and you need iPhotos if you want to get photos onto your computer.</li>
<li>Apple’s phone screen size is less as compared to Android. As iPhone 6Plus has 5.5 inch screen size but some people want large screen with easier to use keyboardand more immersive browsing and movie watching experience.</li>
<li>The battery in an iPhone is fixed with no option to swap it out. But with android you can remove the battery and replace it with new one.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people consider their iPhone as precious possession and  there’s a good chance that you are not treating your phone as well as you should be.  Here are some things you might be doing wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhones are not really designed to withstand with hot and super cool weather. Using your iPhone outside when it’s less than 32 degrees or over 95 degrees can drain the battery or even shut it off temporarily. So wherever you are out in extreme weather, keep your phone turn off or atleast in pocket</li>
<li>Use a soft lint-free cloth in order to clean your iPhone.</li>
<li>Many people have their Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on forever which is wrong. keeping these on all the time will also drain the battery. If you want to save your iPhone battery then shut the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi off when you aren’t using it.</li>
<li>People thinks that Apple charges are expensive so they prefer off brand charger. As Apple chargersmay be expensive, but they are worth the investment. Using off brands chargers can cause damage to your iPhone and can drain ypur battery life.</li>
<li>Keep your iPhone brightness settings to average. It can save your battery life.</li>
<li>Many people do not lock their iPhones with passcode. If you are not using passcode, there is a possibility to stolen your personal information. Having a passcode on your iPhone is the easiest way to protect your privacy from thieves or everyone around.</li>
<li>Do not turn off your iPhone periodically, it degrade your iPhone battery life.</li>
<li>Charging your iPhone for too long time can make your battery damage and actually make battery die quickly.</li>
<li>When you installed any app, it ask you if you want to allow for push notification or not. Don’t allow for push notification unless you absolutely have to.</li>
<li>Apps like Uber and Maps need access to your &#8220;location services&#8221; to work properly, Turned off your location. App will tell you when they need you to turn on that feature</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays everyone loves photography and if you use your iPhone in right way you can take awesome pictures. Apple included very excellent hardware and smart software to make it smart. There are some ways to take great looking pictures.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use two hands to handle your iPhone</strong> – To take better pictures hold on your device with two hands. As iPhone device is light and thin, but still it can move while taking pictures. if possible, Rest your phone on something sturdy surface.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use</strong> <strong>HDR over Flash</strong> – Use HDR instead of the flash when you’re faced with tricky lighting conditions. If you take a picture from HDR setting, your iPhone will take 3 pictures very quickly and paste these images to make a better lit image.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Download third party apps</strong> – Downloading third party apps like camera+ and snapseed can make your pictures more effective. These apps are incredible camera photos apps. You can control the exposure and focus points independently.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t use digital zoom</strong> – Don’t use digital zoom while taking a picture. Because digital zooming makes your image grainy and pixelated and can makes it even harder to take a sturdy image. if you want to take something close up actually walk up to it, get close and click.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shoot the same thing with a few times</strong> – You can just take multiple shots of the same thing and one of them will be vastly better than the others.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hold on and tap to lock focus</strong> –iPhone allows you to lock focus while taking picture. Simply tap the screen where you want to set focus and exposure, but instead of releasing your finger, hold it down for a couple of seconds. A larger square will appear where your finger is along with a yellow AE/AF LOCK sign.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Look for good light</strong> &#8211; Keep the sun at your back or stay in the shade. The pictures will definitely look better.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shoot with burst mode</strong> &#8211; Apple included burst mode originally for snapping clear pictures of moving subjects, but it also works well when your camera is moving too. By snapping images in quick succession, You can get a clear shot.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Might be you don&#8217;t know that there are many junk files in your device that consumes a lot of space and that make your phone slow. With a little knowledge you can make a ton of storage space  available on your device</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Clear Safari History And Website Data</strong> &#8211; If you haven’t cleared Safari data in a while, clear it. Because in some cases clearing it can help you to free 1GB+ of storage space on your iPhone or iPad.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Stop using Photo Stream</strong> &#8211; If you have photo Stream turned on, off it.Because Your iPhone&#8217;s Photo Stream automatically synchronize  your last 1,000 photos across your devices.  That means it&#8217;s storing 1,000 photos &#8212; about 1 GB &#8212; twice.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Delete Large iMessage Threads</strong> &#8211; Sharing a lot of photos and videos via iMessage can take a ton of storage space on your device. Deleting such photo/video can claim back quite a lot of space on your device.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Sign up for a streaming music service</strong> &#8211; The days of storing all your songs on your device has gone. So delete all the music stored locally and stream via cloud. It can save a valuable space on your device.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Update To Latest iOS Version</strong> &#8211; If you are on an early version of iOS and don’t worry about your jailbreak, then update it to the latest versions of iOS to take away a lot of storage space from iOS devices. To update to latest version of iOS via OTA, head to Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Software Update and update form there.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Use Google+ or Dropbox for storing photos</strong> &#8211; You might not want to take all your photos off your phone, and you don&#8217;t have to. But you can save space by having your photo library back up automatically to a cloud storage system.</li>
</ol>

<li><strong>Delete apps, you dont need</strong> &#8211; There are many apps you download in your device and used it only once. If you don’t use those apps, Delete them. Because there are many apps in your  device that are  only 10MB to 50MB in size and games can be 500MB to 1GB in size but they may contain a cache files to help them load content faster and cache files can take large storage space on your device.So delete those apps that you are not using.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Apple Watch Is Right on Time for Supreme Market Integration</strong></p>
<p>It did not take long for Apple to become the number one most effective tech influence on global markets, but that does not mean their roots through the industry do not run deep. For the foreseeable future, Apple holds the reins on integrating social media, branding, home office, global outreach, and both client- and employee-based communications. Every year brings some new development to more fully seal this deal, and all of this seems right on time, every time, since the announcement of the Apple Watch, released in April and coming to stores in June. Alongside hardware that continuously becomes legendary even before its release date, Aryavrat InfoTech Inc offers software integration via sleek apps designed specifically with Apple products in mind and consultation to help companies make the most of the amazing outreach opportunities the evolving market represents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Already a great success, Apple Pay promises to revolutionize payment fluidity and mobility, having garnered nearly 2% of the payment market within only the first month following its release. With more apps coming to enable more fluid, more instantaneous integration every step of the way, it behooves companies to adapt their performance measures to this flick of wrist integration. Our involvement as one of the very first app development teams and providers for the genesis of this monumental new product makes a lot of sense. In fact, once you have experienced the ease with which Aryavrat InfoTech Inc apps and consultations bring your entire business scheme together, you will understand how running or interacting with your business on a daily basis can be seamless pleasure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may remember the days when work hierarchy, slow-method integrations, and memo-based communications were the only means of control for management, but it is more likely that you do not remember this at all. The stunning evolution of technology is such that we are decades removed from the paper pushing and phone ballet that had fingers tripping over each other to transfer calls from one office to another. Today’s successful integrations happen at your wrist and fingertips, and there is no time like the present to dive right into a better understanding of the ease-of-use apps and services provided by Aryavrat Infotech Inc to accompany this exciting technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is time for you and your business to come into perfect sync with the world. Aryavrat Infotech is prepared to help you do that and to help you maintain that cutting edge advantage. With every aspect of your social, communal, and business interactions and markets integrated for wearable use, the movers and shakers of tomorrow are more liberated than ever to operate effectively for optimum success anywhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Apple,</strong> a wonderful combination of lifestyle and Tech Company came out with a unique product called <strong>Apple Watch</strong>. Apple watch, the most anticipated product for the year 2015 is the most personal computer on the wrist of your hand, a real crossover that wades into waters of technology and horology. It is product for everybody with everyday life.</p>
<h1>What I like about the Apple Watch</h1>
<p>Many excellent features and apps, one feature though stands is the Fitness Tracker.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fitness is not just running, jumping, swimming or hitting the gym, it is also about being active by just simple movement like standing which the Apple watch prompts you to do so; an excellent feature.</li>
<li>Apple makes great products; the watch quality is good with scratch resistant and waterproof. It is a durable device.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What I learnt</h1>
<ul>
<li>Apple exercise app is a green icon easily located and is simple to set up. One chooses from the list of exercises and selects the goal. The heart rate monitor works great and gives out accurate reading while jogging.</li>
<li>In weight lifting the heart rate monitor only gives out accurate reading while taking rest in between the lifts. This feature can be overcome by using a Bluetooth chest strap. This helps to give the user accurate reading.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two different apps that work together in a fitness tracker. They collect data from your workout.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Health App</strong> imparts a large perspective of the overall health. The different metrics feature gives users personalized customization experience, which can be initially set up. Also the health app on the Iphone shows what sources (for example Bluetooth chest strap) are used to collect data.</li>
<li><strong>Activity App &#8211;</strong> It is customized for exercise and features a calendar view of your workout. It breaks down the data into 3 different categories</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Move: Red in color, determines your resting/ activity calories</li>
<li>Exercise: Green in color, exhibit details of many minutes you worked out</li>
<li>Stand: Blue in color gives the count of how many times you stood up</li>
</ul>
<h1>There are few things that are missing to make it excellent fitness tracker</h1>
<ol>
<li>No on-board integrated GPS, it only works with a Iphone</li>
<li>No software on sleep tracker</li>
<li>Workout mode battery life is 6.5 hr. Heart rate sensor is on during workout session.</li>
<li>Expensive device</li>
</ol>
<p>Though some missing features, it is best of both worlds. A good fitness tracker for an average fitness person but adding other Bluetooth sources makes for more optimum serious workout. With an integrated accelerometer and software, it is convenient fitness tracker and the great additional features just add to its beauty. A magnificent watch that changes your life through every click.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Many more business use cases could be developed around this personalized Apple product and we at</strong> <strong>Arya (<a href="http://www.aryausa.com/">www.aryausa.com</a> ) ,would love to, help you, to connect your existing applications with Apple Watch. At Arya, we also provide free consulting regarding Apple Watch and give you insights about how we can help your business grow with latest technology trend.</strong></p>
