The goal of these designs is to create an experience that is tailored to the user&#8217;s needs and can be accessed on a variety of devices. Here are 7 critical elements you need to focus on if you want your website to stand out in today&#8217;s competitive market:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Branding with a Logo<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A professional website design should always have a logo to brand the layout. The primary reason for this is because most people will remember the site by its brand identity logo rather than remembering what it was they were trying to find on that particular page or blog post. Modern logos are designed with minimalism in mind, which means less text &#8211; think about Apple Inc.&#8217;s famous apple symbol being their only representation of identity instead of having the word &#8220;Apple&#8221; or any other words appearing in the design. A good rule of thumb when designing your own logo is to make sure you&#8217;re using simple line drawings, shapes, and colors that are easy on the eyes (think Google&#8217;s minimalist logo). Also, make sure you avoid <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.logodesign.net\/logo-design-mistakes-avoid\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mistakes in designing a company logo<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so that your design can stick out from the noise.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Responsive Layout Design<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The days of different versions for desktop and mobile are over. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/webflow.com\/blog\/web-design-trends-2021\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">modern web design trend<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is to create responsive websites that automatically adjust according to the device used or screen size &#8211; this means you don&#8217;t need a separate version for both! This also has the added benefit of increased reach, as more people in developing countries where internet access is limited will be able to see your site with their smartphone than would have been possible before. Avoiding creating separate versions saves time, effort, and money which allows you more freedom when designing your layout because it does not require much work on your part!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0A responsive web design works by automatically adjusting elements in order for them to fit properly into any given display. This means less work for you as the designer which allows you more time to focus on other important aspects of your site!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>HTML Coding\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modern websites are built using HTML coding language and use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) stylesheets to create their layouts. The advantage here is that these languages can be updated without having to go through tedious troubleshooting like older technologies would require or have trouble updating at all because they simply cannot be upgraded.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Conversion Optimized Website\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developing an aesthetically pleasing, well-designed website is only half the battle; you also need one that converts traffic into customers &#8211; this means making sure your content does not contain typos and other errors which could turn away viewers before they even get through the doorway. A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/neilpatel.com\/what-is-conversion-optimization\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conversion-optimized webpage<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> does just what it sounds like: convert those browsing visitors into paying customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below are some tips to help you build conversion-optimized sites:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have text that&#8217;s easy to read and understand<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Provide a clear call to action (CTA) button\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid flashing images or graphics on the page, as they can be irritating for some viewers<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Include testimonials and case studies\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Showcase your company&#8217;s history<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>Mobile Responsive<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meet the new boss; same as the old boss &#8211; just smaller! Mobile devices like smartphones now make up over half of all global web traffic so providing responsive layouts or designs with small screens in mind can really help boost those numbers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Accessibility<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today&#8217;s modern web design trends have a heavy emphasis on accessibility because it provides opportunities for users with disabilities. Achieving this means examining your website and identifying anything that may not be accessible to all audiences &#8211; like assistive technologies or otherwise limited resources. Once you know what the problem is, then see how you can fix it! There are plenty of tools available online which will help make things easier on designers who might lack certain skill sets.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Security\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number one priority in today&#8217;s digital world should always come down to security. This means making sure that your site is protected from hackers and other cyber threats. The best way to do this is by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudflare.com\/learning\/ssl\/what-is-ssl\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which encrypts all data passed between your server and the end-user. Make sure to install SSL on your site as soon as you host your domain &#8211; hackers are already out there waiting to take advantage of you!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from SSL, other things you can do to enhance the security of your website include:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Configuring security features on your hosting service, like password protection and a firewall.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use a strong password that&#8217;s not common or easy to guess<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of two-step verification which means that before logging into your site, you&#8217;ll need to provide the username and password in addition to a code sent via text message.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use login attempts blocking plugins or a firewall plugin that can block hackers by preventing login attempts<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/get-in-touch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2448 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/77.png\" alt=\"Have a project in mind?\" width=\"750\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/77.png 750w, https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/77-300x68.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><b>Final Thoughts<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to keep up with modern web design trends so that your customers don&#8217;t feel like they&#8217;re being taken back ten years or more when visiting your website along with the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our custom <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website development Company in USA<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> build efficient and innovative digital tools for your business<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
