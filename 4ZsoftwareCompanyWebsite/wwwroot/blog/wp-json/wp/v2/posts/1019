In reality, 85% of them failed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the survey, every 2 of 3 startups failed doesn\u2019t matter for which industry they are working. In industry-wise, the IT industry failure rate is higher than any other industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most start-ups fail because they make mistakes, they could have prevented. To overcome these entrepreneurs should be aware of common challenges. Once you\u2019re aware, things will allow you to work on tasks that actually create value.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">W<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hat is Technology Startup<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A tech startup is a company whose vision is to bring new technology products or services to market or deliver existing technology products or services in new ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Technology Startups Fail?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mostly startup missions fail. Often, the fatal blow is not to hire the right people. The wrong hiring in high growth business costs significantly more than in a slower-growing company. You can literally put your survival at stake when it comes to an executive leadership role.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reasons why Startups Failed:<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Business Model:- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common reason for startup failure is startup founder&#8217;s assuming a brilliant idea is enough to run the business and they don&#8217;t think about customer needs and market study and decisions. That led to this startup&#8217;s failure<\/span>.<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>Poor Management Team or lack of expertise:-<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A common problem that causes startups to fail is poor management and challenges with the development team.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Entrepreneurs are unwilling to invest much money in development, initially, they look for a cheap solution and don&#8217;t hire technical expertise. This is the reason for low-quality products.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poor management causes a big failure. That means the team doesn&#8217;t know company needs and by which delays are occurred that also affect product quality.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are usually poor at execution, which leads to issues with the product not getting built correctly or on time, and the go-to-market execution will be poorly implemented.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Premature Scaling:-<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Premature scaling basically means too much, too soon. Entrepreneurs are in a hurry to scale their product, they are in a hurry to transform their startup into a business. At that point, they are out of order and according to the study, it is the cause of 90% of failed startups.<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>Running out of cash:- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fourth major reason that startups fail is that they ran out of cash. The startup runs out of cash because when you start a business, In the early stages of a business, we spend lots of money with no sense. This is a really common mistake, and will just result in a fast burn, and lots of frustration.<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/4-ways_to_making-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2040\" src=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/4-ways_to_making-1.jpg\" alt=\"4 ways_to_making\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/4-ways_to_making-1.jpg 750w, https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/4-ways_to_making-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/4-ways_to_making-1-272x182.jpg 272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preventions:\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Hire the Best Team to Make a profitable Startup-<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Counterintuitive reasons for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/why-outsourcing-is-a-good-option\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hiring will increase your earnings &amp; profits as well<\/a><strong>.<\/strong> You will have greater clarity and vision.
