But nowadays, customer attention seeker is mobile app development whether its mobile app development company or businesses looking to develop a mobile application for them. To serve the mobile app development requirement, there are numerous programming tools available in the market. It is Flutter that has gained more popularity and adoption. Let us discuss Flutter in detail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1886 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/app_development_illu_k25BW.jpg\" alt=\"app development illustration\" width=\"626\" height=\"417\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/app_development_illu_k25BW.jpg 626w, https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/app_development_illu_k25BW-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/app_development_illu_k25BW-272x182.jpg 272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Flutter?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flutter is created by Google. This is an open-source UI software development kit and used for cross-platform Mobile App Development. It means the application developed using Flutter can be run on the different operating systems including Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web using a single codebase.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flutter was introduced in 2015 as a beta version named \u201cSky\u201d. However, Google with time works on Flutter improvement by resolving issues that occurred during Mobile App Development. In 2018, Google released a Flutter stable version named Flutter 1.0 introduced at the Flutter Live event. After that, it started gaining popularity in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/mobile-app-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mobile App Development Services in USA<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2019, the Flutter released its latest version of Flutter 1.12, this was Google\u2019s biggest release of the year. This version was released by resolving 5303 issues, and 5970 Pull requests from around 484 contributors around the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While on 6th May 2020, Flutter 1.17 version was released, in this version Metal API was added, iOS device performance improved, new material widgets and network tracking tools were also added.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flutter code is written in the Dart programming language. Let\u2019s have a brief introduction to Dart.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Dart?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dart is a programming language created by Google. Dart used to develop a mobile app, web servers, and also utilities for IoT devices. In the latest version of Flutter 1.17, the Dart programming language has been updated from Dart 2.7 to Dart 2.8. The updated Dart offers an extra advantage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Javascript compiler compiles the code in Dart. Writing code in Dart is quite similar to writing code in Java and c#.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flutter Working<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Flutter app development is all about a combination of widgets. It provides different types of widgets like structure, styling, layout, and others. Using these widgets, one can easily craft a UI of a mobile app. Flutter doesn\u2019t face any issue while complaining about the programming language to other platforms using Javascript. Flutter comes with a reactive style view and employs Dart for writing apps that\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t face issues.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dart automatically compiles ahead of time into native code for different platforms without using the Javascript bridge. This scaled up the app startup time automatically to the next level.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flutter is the only <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/top-cross-platform-app-development-framework-in-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cross-platform mobile app development<\/a> that comes with a reactive view. This attracts a number of developers towards Flutter.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Flutter is best from other cross-platform frameworks?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flutter&#8217;s outstanding features make it unique from other cross-platform mobile application frameworks. The flutter feature includes:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Single Code<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You can write Flutter code once and use it for developing apps on both iOS and Android.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hot Reload<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This feature allows you to see instant results of changes made in code. This improves the performance of the application. There is no need to reload the app because changes happen in real-time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Widget<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flutter has a wide range of widgets to create UI\/UX views. You can also create your own widgets according to your needs and you can save it for further use.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High Performance<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flutter is the best to run your application as compared to other cross-platform mobile app frameworks. It uses Dart programming language that enables applications to offer native performance with a speed of 60 FPS.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flutter App Development Benefits<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flutter App is beneficial for business owners in many ways:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consume Less Time<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flutter uses a single codebase for both platforms iOS and Android. This results in less consumption of time and resources throughout the development process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High Performance<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile Apps developed using the Flutter framework are highly efficient in performance. Flutter uses Dart as a programming language and has its own widgets that enable fast start-up time and lesser performance issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lower Development Time<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hot reload feature made an instant view of changes made in code. If any error occurs that can be resolved in no time and the developer can keep on working.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compatibility<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flutter applications are compatible with different platforms. It also supports different versions of OS. the use of its own widgets lesser the compatibility issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open Source<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flutter is an open-source framework that allows developers around the globe to help each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/get-in-touch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/get-in-touch noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1887 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/request_a_quote_2.jpg\" alt=\"Request A Quote \" width=\"750\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/request_a_quote_2.jpg 750w, https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/request_a_quote_2-300x68.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Future of Flutter in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/looking-for-an-awesome-mobile-app-development-company-in-the-usa\">Mobile App Development<\/a><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to my view, Flutter has a bright future and can achieve greater heights in the coming future. Flutter recently witnessed the launch of its latest version Flutter 1.12 with improvement. The latest version helps to build an amazing UX\/UX view and high app performance, The time and resources used also reduce. Flutter will grow amazingly in the upcoming future with its many new versions like Flutter 1.13 and 1.14.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><script type=\"application\/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https:\/\/schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n  \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n    \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n    \"@id\": \"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/is-flutter-the-future-of-mobile-app-development\"\n  },\n  \"headline\": \"Is Flutter The Future Of Mobile App Development?\",\n  \"description\": \"Flutter is created by Google.
