More than 70% of websites have been converted into mobile applications. But do you ever think about why mobile applications are so important these days? This is because mobile nowadays is considered a basic need of the generation. These applications play an important role in the vital role of mobile phones in our lives.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are millions of mobile apps available on the Google play store and Apple store. How we select the best application for ourselves? This fully depends on the need, but the major factors we see before choosing any mobile application are design, performance, speed, security, and many more factors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile application technology started with a single technology ie. Native App Development. This allows developers to develop an application for different platforms iOS and Android. But it causes some problems and to resolve them cross-platform was introduced to developers. This new innovation took mobile technology to the next level.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/native-vs-hybrid-app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">React Native is one of the best <\/span><\/a>cross-platform app development technologies <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">used successfully by many organizations across the world.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s start with some basic points of React Native<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is React Native?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">React Native is an open-source mobile application framework developed by Facebook. React Native has an MIT License. This is a Javascript-based framework used to develop hybrid <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/mobile-app-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mobile App Development Services in USA<\/a>\u00a0for Android, IOS, Web, and UWP.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How much React Native takes time for development?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">React Native code is written once and runs on multiple platforms. It takes approx 50% less time than Native to develop an application.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building an app in React Native expensive?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">React Native is the best choice when you want to build your application on both Android and iOS. It saves money from hiring two different developers and also makes the launch quicker.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does React Native give the same performance as Native Applications?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">React Native applications provide better performance than native applications. There are some advanced features present that help in lessening the load time and also make performance faster.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How React Native saves the launching time?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than 90% of the code is shared between iOS and Android that means developers don\u2019t need to write code differently. This saves development time. This helps in the quick launch of the application in the market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can even integrate your current native application with React Native.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1890\" src=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/screen_shot_2020_09__91o4v.jpg\" alt=\"React\" width=\"681\" height=\"309\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/screen_shot_2020_09__91o4v.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/screen_shot_2020_09__91o4v-300x136.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/screen_shot_2020_09__91o4v-768x349.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px\" \/> <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benefits of React Native App Development<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Code Reusability<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/React_Native\">React Native<\/a> code can be reused for both platforms iOS and Android. As React Native is an open-source library this means its code can be reused according to the needs. This saves time and cost. The best benefit is that the same code is used for web applications also. This lessens the development time and increases launch time.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UI Wide Range<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">React Native is an open-source and free cross-platform app development framework; developers from across the globe can share their design and code in the community. The code can be reused and customized by anyone. The users have numerous UI designs to choose from. React Native offers numerous creative and responsive designs with less loading time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stability<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">React Native is known for the data binding process. This increases the reliability of the application. This only provides the updating of specific components and if any update is required modification will be done first and then the updating process.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plugins Support<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">React Native also supports third-party plugins as it includes the native modules and Javascript modules. A large number of third-party plugins can be used without any trouble. There are a lot of options for the user to make their application user-friendly and feature-rich.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/get-in-touch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/get-in-touch noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1891 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/request_a_quote_3.jpg\" alt=\"Request A Quote (3)\" width=\"750\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/request_a_quote_3.jpg 750w, https:\/\/www.aryausa.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/request_a_quote_3-300x68.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">React Native saves time and is also cost-effective.
